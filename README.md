# Template files for submissions to the Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society

This repository contains new LaTeX and Microsoft Word template files
for submissions to the Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science
Society, to be used starting with the 2019 conference:

  http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/conference/cogsci-2019/

New to the 2019 conference, 6-page paper submissions will be reviewed
double-blind, so submissions must be anonymized.  The template files
you will find in this repository have been updated from the template
files from previous years reflecting this change to anonymized paper
submissions.

The simplest way to download and use these templates is to click on
the green **Clone or download** button at the right-hand side of this
page above all the file names, and choose **Download ZIP**.
Alternatively, you can use [Git](https://git-scm.com) to clone this repository
yourself.

**Microsoft Word users:** please note that the template files are in
[`.dotx` format](https://file.org/extension/dotx), not `.doc` or
`.docx` format.  When you open one of the template files in Word, edit
it and then save it, Word will ask you for a new filename and (by
default) save your paper under that new filename in `.docx` format.


**IMPORTANT UPDATE 15 Jan 2019:** fixed a bug in `cogsci.sty` that apparently
caused trouble in Overleaf.  A minimal working example of using the LaTeX
template in Overleaf for the 6-page submission format can be found at
https://v2.overleaf.com/read/wwwzyhdxtyhg; in this example,
`cogsci_template.tex` has been renamed `main.tex` and you are off to
the races.
