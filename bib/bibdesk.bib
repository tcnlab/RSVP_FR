	Abstract = {Our visual memory percepts of whether we have encountered specific objects or scenes before are hypothesized to manifest as decrements in neural responses in inferotemporal cortex (IT) with stimulus repetition. To evaluate this proposal, we recorded IT neural responses as two monkeys performed a single-exposure visual memory task designed to measure the rates of forgetting with time. We found that a weighted linear read-out of IT was a better predictor of the monkeys' forgetting rates and reaction time patterns than a strict instantiation of the repetition suppression hypothesis, expressed as a total spike count scheme. Behavioral predictions could be attributed to visual memory signals that were reflected as repetition suppression and were intermingled with visual selectivity, but only when combined across the most sensitive neurons.},

@article{HowaKahn17,
	Abstract = {Goal-directed behavior is sensitive to the current value of expected outcomes. This requires independent representations of specific rewards, which have been linked to orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) function. However, the mechanisms by which the human brain updates specific goals on the fly, and translates those updates into choices, have remained unknown. Here we implemented selective devaluation of appetizing food odors in combination with pattern-based neuroimaging and a decision-making task. We found that in a hungry state, participants chose to smell high-intensity versions of two value-matched food odor rewards. After eating a meal corresponding to one of the two odors, participants switched choices toward the low intensity of the sated odor but continued to choose the high intensity of the nonsated odor. This sensory-specific behavioral effect was mirrored by pattern-based changes in fMRI signal in lateral posterior OFC, where specific reward identity representations were altered after the meal for the sated food odor but retained for the nonsated counterpart. In addition, changes in functional connectivity between the OFC and general value coding in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) predicted individual differences in satiety-related choice behavior. These findings demonstrate how flexible representations of specific rewards in the OFC are updated by devaluation, and how functional connections to vmPFC reflect the current value of outcomes and guide goal-directed behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for goal-directed behavior. A recent proposal is that OFC fulfills this function by representing a variety of state and task variables ("cognitive maps"), including a conjunction of expected reward identity and value. Here we tested how identity-specific representations of food odor reward are updated by satiety. We found that fMRI pattern-based signatures of reward identity in lateral posterior OFC were modulated after selective devaluation, and that connectivity between this region and general value coding ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) predicted choice behavior. These results provide evidence for a mechanism by which devaluation modulates a cognitive map of expected reward in OFC and thereby alters general value signals in vmPFC to guide goal-directed behavior.},

	Abstract = {Nervous systems must encode information about the identity of expected outcomes to make adaptive decisions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying identity-specific value signaling remain poorly understood. By manipulating the value and identity of appetizing food odors in a pattern-based imaging paradigm of human classical conditioning, we were able to identify dissociable predictive representations of identity-specific reward in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and identity-general reward in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Reward-related functional coupling between OFC and olfactory (piriform) cortex and between vmPFC and amygdala revealed parallel pathways that support identity-specific and -general predictive signaling. The demonstration of identity-specific value representations in OFC highlights a role for this region in model-based behavior and reveals mechanisms by which appetitive behavior can go awry. },

@article{HowaKahn18,
	Abstract = {There is general consensus that dopaminergic midbrain neurons signal reward prediction errors, computed as the difference between expected and received reward value. However, recent work in rodents shows that these neurons also respond to errors related to inferred value and sensory features, indicating an expanded role for dopamine beyond learning cached values. Here we utilize a transreinforcer reversal learning task and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test whether prediction error signals in the human midbrain are evoked when the expected identity of an appetitive food odor reward is violated, while leaving value matched. We found that midbrain fMRI responses to identity and value errors are correlated, suggesting a common neural origin for these error signals. Moreover, changes in reward-identity expectations, encoded in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), are directly related to midbrain activity, demonstrating that identity-based error signals in the midbrain support the formation of outcome identity expectations in OFC.},

	Abstract = {Neural network remodeling underpins the ability to remember life experiences, but little is known about the long-term plasticity of neural populations. To study how the brain encodes episodic events, we used time-lapse two-photon microscopy and a fluorescent reporter of neural plasticity based on an enhanced form of the synaptic activity-responsive element (E-SARE) within the Arc promoter to track thousands of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells over weeks in mice that repeatedly encountered different environments. Each environment evokes characteristic patterns of ensemble neural plasticity, but with each encounter, the set of activated cells gradually evolves. After repeated exposures, the plasticity patterns evoked by an individual environment progressively stabilize. Compared with young adults, plasticity patterns in aged mice are less specific to individual environments and less stable across repeat experiences. Long-term consolidation of hippocampal plasticity patterns may support long-term memory formation, whereas weaker consolidation in aged subjects might reflect declining memory function.},

	Abstract = {Memories are not stored in isolation from other memories but are integrated into associative networks. However, the mechanisms underlying memory association remain elusive. Using two amygdala-dependent behavioral paradigms-conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and auditory-cued fear conditioning (AFC)-in mice, we found that presenting the conditioned stimulus used for the CTA task triggered the conditioned response of the AFC task after natural coreactivation of the memories. This was accompanied through an increase in the overlapping neuronal ensemble in the basolateral amygdala. Silencing of the overlapping ensemble suppressed CTA retrieval-induced freezing. However, retrieval of the original CTA or AFC memory was not affected. A small population of coshared neurons thus mediates the link between memories. They are not necessary for recalling individual memories.},

But its neural circuit mechanisms remain mysterious. Investigating it in rodents has recently become possible, facilitating perturbation experiments to delineate the relevant causal circuit, as well as the application of other tools more readily available in rodents. In addition, advances in stimulus design and analysis have aided studying the relevant neural encoding. In complement to ongoing non-human primate studies, these newly available model systems and tools place the field at an exciting time that suggests that the dynamical circuit mechanisms underlying accumulation of evidence could soon be revealed.},

	Abstract = {Sequential activation of neurons is a common feature of network activity during a variety of behaviors, including working memory and decision making. Previous network models for sequences and memory emphasized specialized architectures in which a principled mechanism is pre-wired into their connectivity. Here we demonstrate that, starting from random connectivity and modifying a small fraction of connections, a largely disordered recurrent network can produce sequences and implement working memory efficiently. We use this process, called Partial In-Network Training (PINning), to model and match cellular resolution imaging data from the posterior parietal cortex during a virtual memory-guided two-alternative forced-choice task. Analysis of the connectivity reveals that sequences propagate by the cooperation between recurrent synaptic interactions and external inputs, rather than through feedforward or asymmetric connections. Together our results suggest that neural sequences may emerge through learning from largely unstructured network architectures. },

	Abstract = {To guide navigation, the nervous system integrates multisensory self-motion and landmark information. We dissected how these inputs generate spatial representations by recording entorhinal grid, border and speed cells in mice navigating virtual environments. Manipulating the gain between the animal's locomotion and the visual scene revealed that border cells responded to landmark cues while grid and speed cells responded to combinations of locomotion, optic flow and landmark cues in a context-dependent manner, with optic flow becoming more influential when it was faster than expected. A network model explained these results by revealing a phase transition between two regimes in which grid cells remain coherent with or break away from the landmark reference frame. Moreover, during path-integration-based navigation, mice estimated their position following principles predicted by our recordings. Together, these results provide a theoretical framework for understanding how landmark and self-motion cues combine during navigation to generate spatial representations and guide behavior.},

However, evidence for predictive coding, reward sensitivity and policy dependence in place cells suggests that the representation is not purely spatial. We approach this puzzle from a reinforcement learning perspective: what kind of spatial representation is most useful for maximizing future reward? We show that the answer takes the form of a predictive representation. This representation captures many aspects of place cell responses that fall outside the traditional view of a cognitive map. Furthermore, we argue that entorhinal grid cells encode a low-dimensionality basis set for the predictive representation, useful for suppressing noise in predictions and extracting multiscale structure for hierarchical planning.},

However, there are a number of distinct algorithms which are described by the term "predictive coding". This article provides a concise review of these different predictive coding algorithms, highlighting their similarities and differences. Five algorithms are covered: linear predictive coding which has a long and influential history in the signal processing literature; the first neuroscience-related application of predictive coding to explaining the function of the retina; and three versions of predictive coding that have been proposed to model cortical function. While all these algorithms aim to fit a generative model to sensory data, they differ in the type of generative model they employ, in the process used to optimise the fit between the model and sensory data, and in the way that they are related to neurobiology.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers prediction and perceptual categorization as an inference problem that is solved by the brain. We assume that the brain models the world as a hierarchy or cascade of dynamical systems that encode causal structure in the sensorium. Perception is equated with the optimization or inversion of these internal models, to explain sensory data. Given a model of how sensory data are generated, we can invoke a generic approach to model inversion, based on a free energy bound on the model's evidence. The ensuing free-energy formulation furnishes equations that prescribe the process of recognition, i.e. the dynamics of neuronal activity that represent the causes of sensory input. Here, we focus on a very general model, whose hierarchical and dynamical structure enables simulated brains to recognize and predict trajectories or sequences of sensory states. We first review hierarchical dynamical models and their inversion. We then show that the brain has the necessary infrastructure to implement this inversion and illustrate this point using synthetic birds that can recognize and categorize birdsongs.},

When exposed to natural images, a hierarchical network of model neurons implementing such a model developed simple-cell-like receptive fields. A subset of neurons responsible for carrying the residual errors showed endstopping and other extra-classical receptive-field effects. These results suggest that rather than being exclusively feedforward phenomena, nonclassical surround effects in the visual cortex may also result from cortico-cortical feedback as a consequence of the visual system using an efficient hierarchical strategy for encoding natural images.},

	Abstract = {Chunking allows the brain to efficiently organize memories and actions. Although basal ganglia circuits have been implicated in action chunking, little is known about how individual elements are concatenated into a behavioral sequence at the neural level. Using a task in which mice learned rapid action sequences, we uncovered neuronal activity encoding entire sequences as single actions in basal ganglia circuits. In addition to neurons with activity related to the start/stop activity signaling sequence parsing, we found neurons displaying inhibited or sustained activity throughout the execution of an entire sequence. This sustained activity covaried with the rate of execution of individual sequence elements, consistent with motor concatenation. Direct and indirect pathways of basal ganglia were concomitantly active during sequence initiation, but behaved differently during sequence performance, revealing a more complex functional organization of these circuits than previously postulated. These results have important implications for understanding the functional organization of basal ganglia during the learning and execution of action sequences. },

	Abstract = {The basal forebrain comprises several heterogeneous neuronal subgroupings having modular projection patterns to discrete sets of cortical subregions. Each cortical region forms recurrent projections, via prefrontal cortex, that reach the specific basal forebrain subgroups from which they receive afferents. This architecture enables the basal forebrain to selectively modulate cortical responsiveness according to current processing demands. Theoretically, optimal functioning of this distributed network would be enhanced by temporal coordination among coactive basal forebrain neurons, or the emergence of "cell assemblies." The present work demonstrates assembly formation in rat basal forebrain neuronal populations during a selective attention task. Neuron pairs exhibited coactivation patterns organized within beta-frequency time windows (55 ms), regardless of their membership within distinct bursting versus nonbursting basal forebrain subpopulations. Thus, the results reveal a specific temporal framework for integration of information within basal forebrain networks and for the modulation of cortical responsiveness. },

	Abstract = {Cortically projecting basal forebrain neurons play a critical role in learning and attention, and their degeneration accompanies age-related impairments in cognition. Despite the impressive anatomical and cell-type complexity of this system, currently available data suggest that basal forebrain neurons lack complexity in their response fields, with activity primarily reflecting only macro-level brain states such as sleep and wake, onset of relevant stimuli and/or reward obtainment. The current study examined the spiking activity of basal forebrain neuron populations across multiple phases of a selective attention task, addressing, in particular, the issue of complexity in ensemble firing patterns across time. Clustering techniques applied to the full population revealed a large number of distinct categories of task-phase-specific activity patterns. Unique population firing-rate vectors defined each task phase and most categories of task-phase-specific firing had counterparts with opposing firing patterns. An analogous set of task-phase-specific firing patterns was also observed in a population of posterior parietal cortex neurons. Thus, consistent with the known anatomical complexity, basal forebrain population dynamics are capable of differentially modulating their cortical targets according to the unique sets of environmental stimuli, motor requirements, and cognitive processes associated with different task phases. },

	Abstract = {Previous work has revealed a remarkably direct neural correlate of decisions in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Specifically, firing rate has been observed to ramp up or down in a manner resembling the accumulation of evidence for a perceptual decision reported by making a saccade into (or away from) the neuron's response field (RF). However, this link between LIP response and decision formation emerged from studies where a saccadic target was always stimulating the RF during decisions, and where the neural correlate was the averaged activity of a restricted sample of neurons. Because LIP cells are (1) highly responsive to the presence of a visual stimulus in the RF, (2) heterogeneous, and (3) not clearly anatomically segregated from large numbers of neurons that fail selection criteria, the underlying neuronal computations are potentially obscured. To address this, we recorded single neuron spiking activity in LIP during a well-studied moving-dot direction-discrimination task and manipulated whether a saccade target was present in the RF during decision-making. We also recorded from a broad sample of LIP neurons, including ones conventionally excluded in prior studies. Our results show that cells multiplex decision signals with decision-irrelevant visual signals. We also observed disparate, repeating response "motifs" across neurons that, when averaged together, resemble traditional ramping decision signals. In sum, neural responses in LIP simultaneously carry decision signals and decision-irrelevant sensory signals while exhibiting diverse dynamics that reveal a broader range of neural computations than previously entertained.},

	Abstract = {During decision making, neurons in multiple brain regions exhibit responses that are correlated with decisions. However, it remains uncertain whether or not various forms of decision-related activity are causally related to decision making. Here we address this question by recording and reversibly inactivating the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas of rhesus macaques performing a motion direction discrimination task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited firing rate patterns that directly resembled the evidence accumulation process posited to govern decision making, with strong correlations between their response fluctuations and the animal's choices. Neurons in area MT, in contrast, exhibited weak correlations between their response fluctuations and choices, and had firing rate patterns consistent with their sensory role in motion encoding. The behavioural impact of pharmacological inactivation of each area was inversely related to their degree of decision-related activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT profoundly impaired psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no measurable impact on decision-making performance, despite having silenced the very clusters that exhibited strong decision-related activity. Although LIP inactivation did not impair psychophysical behaviour, it did influence spatial selection and oculomotor metrics in a free-choice control task. The absence of an effect on perceptual decision making was stable over trials and sessions and was robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry, arguing against several forms of compensation. Thus, decision-related signals in LIP do not appear to be critical for computing perceptual decisions, and may instead reflect secondary processes. Our findings highlight a dissociation between decision correlation and causation, showing that strong neuron-decision correlations do not necessarily offer direct access to the neural computations underlying decisions.},

	Abstract = {Models of the representation of numerosity information used in discrimination tasks are integrated with a diffusion decision model. The representation models assume distributions of numerosity either with means and SD that increase linearly with numerosity or with means that increase logarithmically with constant SD. The models produce coefficients that are applied to differences between two numerosities to produce drift rates and these drive the decision process. The linear and log models make differential predictions about how response time (RT) distributions and accuracy change with numerosity and which model is successful depends on the task. When the task is to decide which of two side-by-side arrays of dots has more dots, the log model fits decreasing accuracy and increasing RT as numerosity increases. When the task is to decide, for dots of two colors mixed in a single array, which color has more dots, the linear model fits decreasing accuracy and decreasing RT as numerosity increases. For both tasks, variables such as the areas covered by the dots affect performance, but if the task is changed to one in which the subject has to decide whether the number of dots in a single array is more or less than a standard, the variables have little effect on performance. Model parameters correlate across tasks suggesting commonalities in the abilities to perform them. Overall, results show that the representation used depends on the task and no single representation can account for the data from all the paradigms. (PsycINFO Database Record},

	Abstract = {The encoding of time and its binding to events are crucial for episodic memory, but how these processes are carried out in hippocampal--entorhinal circuits is unclear. Here we show in freely foraging rats that temporal information is robustly encoded across time scales from seconds to hours within the overall population state of the lateral entorhinal cortex. Similarly pronounced encoding of time was not present in the medial entorhinal cortex or in hippocampal areas CA3--CA1. When animals'experiences were constrained by behavioural tasks to become similar across repeated trials, the encoding of temporal flow across trials was reduced, whereas the encoding of time relative to the start of trials was improved. The findings suggest that populations of lateral entorhinal cortex neurons represent time inherently through the encoding of experience. This representation of episodic time may be integrated with spatial inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex in the hippocampus, allowing the hippocampus to store a unified representation of what, where and when.},

Prior research has examined this issue only in a spotty fashion, usually with very short time intervals. In a study aimed at characterizing spacing effects over significant durations, more than 1,350 individuals were taught a set of facts and--after a gap of up to 3.5 months--given a review. A final test was administered at a further delay of up to 1 year. At any given test delay, an increase in the interstudy gap at first increased, and then gradually reduced, final test performance. The optimal gap increased as test delay increased. However, when measured as a proportion of test delay, the optimal gap declined from about 20 to 40% of a 1-week test delay to about 5 to 10% of a 1-year test delay. The interaction of gap and test delay implies that many educational practices are highly inefficient.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampal theta oscillation is strongly correlated with behaviors such as memory and spatial navigation, but we do not understand its specific functional role. One hint of theta's function came from the discovery in rodents that theta oscillations are traveling waves that allow parts of the hippocampus to simultaneously exhibit separate oscillatory phases. Because hippocampal theta oscillations in humans have different properties compared with rodents, we examined these signals directly using multielectrode recordings from neurosurgical patients. Our findings confirm that human hippocampal theta oscillations are traveling waves, but also show that these oscillations appear at a broader range of frequencies compared with rodents. Human traveling waves showed a distinctive pattern of spatial propagation such that there is a consistent phase spread across the hippocampus regardless of the oscillations' frequency. This suggests that traveling theta oscillations are important functionally in humans because they coordinate phase coding throughout the hippocampus in a consistent manner. Significance statement: We show for the first time in humans that hippocampal theta oscillations are traveling waves, moving along the length of the hippocampus in a posterior-anterior direction. The existence of these traveling theta waves is important for understanding hippocampal neural coding because they cause neurons at separate positions in the hippocampus to experience different theta phases simultaneously. The theta phase that a neuron measures is a key factor in how that cell represents behavioral information. Therefore, the existence of traveling theta waves indicates that, to fully understand how a hippocampal neuron represents information, it is vital to also account for that cell's location in addition to conventional measures of neural activity.},

	Abstract = {The ability to represent the world accurately relies on simultaneous coarse and fine-grained neural information coding, capturing both gist and detail of an experience. The longitudinal axis of the hippocampus may provide a gradient of representational granularity in spatial and episodic memory in rodents and humans [1-8]. Rodent place cells in the ventral hippocampus exhibit significantly larger place fields and greater autocorrelation than those in the dorsal hippocampus [1, 9-11], which may underlie a coarser and slower changing representation of space [10, 12]. Recent evidence suggests that properties of cellular dynamics in rodents can be captured with fMRI in humans during spatial navigation [13] and conceptual learning [14]. Similarly, mechanisms supporting granularity along the long axis may also be extrapolated to the scale of fMRI signal. Here, we provide the first evidence for separable scales of representation along the human hippocampal anteroposterior axis during navigation and rest by showing (1) greater similarity among voxel time courses and (2) higher temporal autocorrelation in anterior hippocampus (aHPC), relative to posterior hippocampus (pHPC), the human homologs of ventral and dorsal rodent hippocampus. aHPC voxels exhibited more similar activity at each time point and slower signal change over time than voxels in pHPC, consistent with place field organization in rodents. Importantly, similarity between voxels was related to navigational strategy and episodic memory. These findings provide evidence that the human hippocampus supports an anterior-to-posterior gradient of coarse-to-fine spatiotemporal representations, suggesting the existence of a cross-species mechanism, whereby lower neural similarity supports more complex coding of experience.},

We have found a group of cells in the cerebral cortex of monkeys whose activity is exclusively related to a sequence of multiple movements performed in a particular order. Such cellular activity exists in the supplementary motor area, but not in the primary motor cortex.

A useful starting point is asking what kinds of representations we would want the brain to have, given the constraints on its computational architecture. Following this logic leads to the idea of the successor representation, which encodes states of the environment in terms of their predictive relationships with other states. Recent behavioral and neural studies have provided evidence for the successor representation, and computational studies have explored ways to extend the original idea. This paper reviews progress on these fronts, organizing them within a broader framework for understanding how the brain negotiates tradeoffs between efficiency and flexibility for reinforcement learning.},

	Abstract = {Hippocampal place field sequences are supported by sensory cues and network internal mechanisms. In contrast, sharp-wave (SPW) sequences, theta sequences, and episode field sequences are internally generated. The relationship of these sequences to memory is unclear. SPW sequences have been shown to support learning and have been assumed to also support episodic memory. Conversely, we demonstrate these SPW sequences were present in trained rats even after episodic memory was impaired and after other internal sequences - episode field and theta sequences - were eliminated. SPW sequences did not support memory despite continuing to 'replay' all task-related sequences - place- field and episode field sequences. Sequence replay occurred selectively during synchronous increases of population excitability -- SPWs. Similarly, theta sequences depended on the presence of repeated synchronized waves of excitability - theta oscillations. Thus, we suggest that either intermittent or rhythmic synchronized changes of excitability trigger sequential firing of neurons, which in turn supports learning and/or memory.},

	Abstract = {In decision from experience, the source of probability information affects how probability is distorted in the decision task. Understanding how and why probability is distorted is a key issue in understanding the peculiar character of experience-based decision. We consider how probability information is used not just in decision-making but also in a wide variety of cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks. Very similar patterns of distortion of probability/frequency information have been found in visual frequency estimation, frequency estimation based on memory, signal detection theory, and in the use of probability information in decision-making under risk and uncertainty. We show that distortion of probability in all cases is well captured as linear transformations of the log odds of frequency and/or probability, a model with a slope parameter, and an intercept parameter. We then consider how task and experience influence these two parameters and the resulting distortion of probability. We review how the probability distortions change in systematic ways with task and report three experiments on frequency distortion where the distortions change systematically in the same task. We found that the slope of frequency distortions decreases with the sample size, which is echoed by findings in decision from experience. We review previous models of the representation of uncertainty and find that none can account for the empirical findings.},

	Abstract = {Persistent spiking has been thought to underlie working memory (WM). However, virtually all of the evidence for this comes from studies that averaged spiking across time and across trials, which masks the details. On single trials, activity often occurs in sparse transient bursts. This has important computational and functional advantages. In addition, examination of more complex tasks reveals neural coding in WM is dynamic over the course of a trial. All this suggests that spiking is important for WM, but that its role is more complex than simply persistent spiking.Dual Perspectives Companion Paper:Persistent Spiking Activity Underlies Working Memory, by Christos Constantinidis, Shintaro Funahashi, Daeyeol Lee, John D.

Recent work (Benjamin, Diaz, & Wee, 2009; Mueller & Weidemann, 2008) has challenged this assumption, arguing not only for the existence of criterion noise but also for its large magnitude and substantive contribution to individuals' performance. A review of these recent approaches for the measurement of criterion noise in SDT identifies several shortcomings and confoundings. A reanalysis of Benjamin et al.'s (2009) data sets as well as the results from a new experimental method indicate that the different forms of criterion noise proposed in the recognition memory literature are of very low magnitudes, and they do not provide a significant improvement over the account already given by traditional SDT without criterion noise.},

	Abstract = {The development of memory theory has been constrained by a focus on isolated tasks rather than the processes and information that are common to situations in which memory is engaged. We present results from a study in which 453 participants took part in five different memory tasks: single-item recognition, associative recognition, cued recall, free recall, and lexical decision. Using hierarchical Bayesian techniques, we jointly analyzed the correlations between tasks within individuals-reflecting the degree to which tasks rely on shared cognitive processes-and within items-reflecting the degree to which tasks rely on the same information conveyed by the item. Among other things, we find that (a) the processes involved in lexical access and episodic memory are largely separate and rely on different kinds of information, (b) access to lexical memory is driven primarily by perceptual aspects of a word, (c) all episodic memory tasks rely to an extent on a set of shared processes which make use of semantic features to encode both single words and associations between words, and (d) recall involves additional processes likely related to contextual cuing and response production. These results provide a large-scale picture of memory across different tasks which can serve to drive the development of comprehensive theories of memory. (PsycINFO Database Record},

@article{OlshFiel97,
	Abstract = {The spatial receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian striate cortex have been reasonably well described physiologically and can be characterized as being localized, oriented, and bandpass, comparable with the basis functions of wavelet transforms. Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete--i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Drift--diffusion models (DDMs) are a popular framework for explaining response times in decision-making tasks. Recently, the DDM architecture has been used to model interval timing. The Time-adaptive DDM (TDDM) is a physiologically plausible mechanism that adapts in real-time to different time intervals while preserving timescale invariance. One key open question is how the TDDM could deal with situations where reward is omitted, as in the peak procedure---a benchmark in the timing literature. When reward is omitted, there is a consistent pattern of correlations between the times at which animals start and stop responding. Here we develop a formulation of the TDDM's stationary properties that allows for the derivation of such correlations analytically. Using this simplified formulation we show that a TDDM with two thresholds--one to mark the start of responding and another the stop--can reproduce the same pattern of correlations observed in the data, as long as the start threshold is allowed to be noisy. We confirm this by running simulations with the standard TDDM formulation and show that the simplified formulation approximates well the full model under steady-state conditions. Moreover, we show that this simplified version of the TDDM is formally equivalent to Scalar Expectancy Theory (SET) under stationary behaviours, the most prominent theory of interval timing. This equivalence establishes the TDDM as a more complete drift--diffusion based theory with SET as a special case under steady-state conditions.},

@article{SimeEtal13,
	Abstract = {Pacemaker-accumulator (PA) systems have been the most popular kind of timing model in the half-century since their introduction by Treisman (1963). Many alternative timing models have been designed predicated on different assumptions, though the dominant PA model during this period --- Gibbon and Church's Scalar Expectancy Theory (SET) --- invokes most of them. As in Treisman, SET's implementation assumes a fixed-rate clock-pulse generator and encodes durations by storing average pulse counts; unlike Treisman's model, SET's decision process invokes Weber's law of magnitude-comparison to account for timescale-invariant temporal precision in animal behavior. This is one way to deal with the `Poisson timing' issue, in which relative temporal precision increases for longer durations, contrafactually, in a simplified version of Treisman's model. First, we review the fact that this problem does not afflict Treisman's model itself due to a key assumption not shared by SET. Second, we develop a contrasting PA model, an extension of Killeen and Fetterman's Behavioral Theory of Timing that accumulates Poisson pulses up to a fixed criterion level, with pulse rates adapting to time different intervals. Like Treisman's model, this time-adaptive, opponent Poisson, drift--diffusion model accounts for timescale invariance without first assuming Weber's law. It also makes new predictions about response times and learning speed and connects interval timing to the popular drift--diffusion model of perceptual decision making. With at least three different routes to timescale invariance, the PA model family can provide a more compelling account of timed behavior than may be generally appreciated.},

Here I consider new approaches that explore cell assemblies as the units of information processing and how these approaches are revealing the structure and organization of neural representations in perception and cognition.},

@article{Eich17a,
	Abstract = {The hippocampus is famous for mapping locations in spatially organized environments, and several recent studies have shown that hippocampal networks also map moments in temporally organized experiences. Here I consider how space and time are integrated in the representation of memories. The brain pathways for spatial and temporal cognition involve overlapping and interacting systems that converge on the hippocampal region. There is evidence that spatial and temporal aspects of memory are processed somewhat differently in the circuitry of hippocampal subregions but become fully integrated within CA1 neuronal networks as independent, multiplexed representations of space and time. Hippocampal networks also map memories across a broad range of abstract relations among events, suggesting that the findings on spatial and temporal organization reflect a generalized mechanism for organizing memories.},

	Abstract = {We present a method for learning nonlinear systems, echo state networks (ESNs). ESNs employ artificial recurrent neural networks in a way that has recently been proposed independently as a learning mechanism in biological brains. The learning method is computationally efficient and easy to use. On a benchmark task of predicting a chaotic time series, accuracy is improved by a factor of 2400 over previous techniques. The potential for engineering applications is illustrated by equalizing a communication channel, where the signal error rate is improved by two orders of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {Autonomous neural systems must efficiently process information in a wide range of novel environments which may have very different statistical properties. We consider the problem of how to optimally distribute receptors along a 1-dimensional continuum consistent with the following design principles. First, neural representations of the world should obey a neural uncertainty principle-making as few assumptions as possible about the statistical structure of the world. Second, neural representations should convey, as much as possible, equivalent information about environments with different statistics. The results of these arguments resemble the structure of the visual system and provide a natural explanation of the behavioral Weber-Fechner law, a foundational result in psychology. Because the derivation is extremely general, this suggests that similar scaling relationships should be observed not only in sensory continua, but also in neural representations of "cognitive" 1-dimensional quantities such as time or numerosity.

	Abstract = {The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) shares reciprocal connectivity with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and decreased MD-PFC connectivity is observed in schizophrenia patients. Patients also display cognitive deficits including impairments in working memory, but a mechanistic link between thalamo-prefrontal circuit function and working memory is missing. Using pathway-specific inhibition, we found directional interactions between mouse MD and medial PFC (mPFC), with MD-to-mPFC supporting working memory maintenance and mPFC-to-MD supporting subsequent choice. We further identify mPFC neurons that display elevated spiking during the delay, a feature that was absent on error trials and required MD inputs for sustained maintenance. Strikingly, delay-tuned neurons had minimal overlap with spatially tuned neurons, and each mPFC population exhibited mutually exclusive dependence on MD and hippocampal inputs. These findings indicate a role for MD in sustaining prefrontal activity during working memory maintenance. Consistent with this idea, we found that enhancing MD excitability was sufficient to enhance task performance.},

	Abstract = {Recognition memory accuracy is harmed by prior testing (a.k.a., output interference [OI]; Tulving & Arbuckle, 1966). In several experiments, we interpolated various tasks between recognition test trials. The stimuli and the tasks were more similar (lexical decision [LD] of words and nonwords) or less similar (gender identification of male and female faces) to the stimuli and task used in recognition testing. Not only did the similarity between the interpolated and recognition tasks not affect recognition accuracy but performance of the interpolated task caused no interference in subsequent recognition testing. Only the addition of recognition trials caused OI. When we presented a block of LD trials or gender identification trials before the recognition test, a decrease in accuracy was observed in the subsequent recognition tests. These results suggest a distinction between temporal context and task context, such that recognition memory performance is determined by the salience of the context cues, and the use of temporal context cues is associated with OI.},

hit rates and lower false alarm rates for low-frequency words, is one of the hallmarks of memory.
However, this ``regularity of memory'' is limited because normative WF has been treated as discrete (low
vs. high). We evaluate the extent to which the prototypical WF mirror effect holds when WF is treated
as a continuous variable. We find a clear nonmonotonic U-shaped relationship. Hit rates are higher for
both low-frequency and high-frequency words. Linear and quadratic regression models were fit to the
data at both the item and the participant level, and the quadratic model provided a better fit at both levels.
This finding is inconsistent with the empirical and theoretical finding of a mirror effect and requires a
novel approach to accounting for the role of experience in episodic memory.},

To better understand these effects, we evaluate performance over the course of testing. Output interference (OI) is the decrease in performance across test trials due to an increase in noise caused by encoded test items. Critically, OI is predicted on pure lists if the mnemonic evidence for each test item is evaluated. In two experiments, participants received accurate feedback, no feedback, or random feedback that was unrelated to the response on each test trial and pure or standard test lists. When no feedback was provided, performance was nearly identical for standard and pure test lists, replicating previous findings. Only in the presence of accurate feedback were participants able to successfully adapt to pure list environments and improve their accuracy. Critically, OI was observed, demonstrating that participants continued to evaluate mnemonic evidence even in pure list conditions. We discuss the implication of these data for models of memory.},

	Abstract = {The benefits of testing on later memory performance are well documented; however, the manner in which testing harms memory performance is less well understood. This research is concerned with the finding that accuracy decreases over the course of testing, a phenomena termed ``output interference'' (OI). OI has primarily been investigated with episodic memory, but there is limited research investigating OI in measures of semantic memory (i.e., knowledge). In the current study, participants were twice tested for their knowledge of factual questions; they received corrective feedback during the first test. No OI was observed during the first test, when participants presumably searched semantic memory to answer the general-knowledge questions. During the second test, OI was observed. Conditional analyses of Test 2 performance revealed that OI was largely isolated to questions answered incorrectly during Test 1. These were questions for which participants needed to rely on recent experience (i.e., the feedback in episodic memory) to respond correctly. One possible explanation is that episodic memory is more susceptible to the sort of interference generated during testing (e.g., gradual changes in context, encoding/updating of items) relative to semantic memory. Alternative explanations are considered.},

testing memory affects future behavior. The studies have used differing terminology

the various phenomena have been described in ways, suggesting they differ in substance.
In this chapter, we relate many of these phenomena and show that they might
be due to a set of common memory processes, processes that can act through conscious,
strategic or unconscious, implicit means. The critical strand that links the phenomena
is that memory is a continuous process that constantly stores and retrieves

errors. The current project focused on understanding how memories for recent experiences
interact, or interfere, with other related information. In the experiments, participants
study multiple lists of pairs of items. Items from an initial study list (e.g., A-B) reappear on a
second study list paired with new, other items (e.g., A-Br). Memory performance for A-Br
pairs is contrasted with control pairs exclusive to the second study list (e.g., C-D). We
observed that the correct recall of the second presentation of a target (Br) is better when
cued by its partner (A) despite being studied with a different partner during the initial presentation;
a phenomena called proactive facilitation. We examined multiple possible
explanations for proactive facilitation, including whether proactive facilitation was driven
by changes in response threshold, whether participants encoded the pairs with repeated
items and associations better during the second study list, or whether participants spent
more time searching memory for A-Br pairs. In general, the data appear to be most consistent
with the idea that some items, when encountered a second time, are encoded more

	Abstract = {The representation of item and associative information in episodic memory was investigated using cued recall and single item recognition. In the first four experiments, participants studied two lists constructed such that some items presented in a pair during List 1 were rearranged to create new pairs in List 2 and were accompanied by pairs exclusive to List 2. List 1 was composed of either word--face pairs (Experiment 1 and 3) or word--word and face--face pairs (Experiment 2 and 4). Participants were tested for their memory of the second list containing only word-face pairs. When the test required associative information (i.e., cued recall), interference was specific to pair-type. Specifically, repeating items in the same pair-type across lists led to a greater number of correct and incorrect responses but repeating items in different pair-types did not change performance. When the test did not require associative information (i.e., single item recognition), interference was not specific to pair-type; hits and false alarms were higher for items presented on List 1. In the final experiment, the number of studied pairs and single items was independently manipulated and a pair-specific list length effect was observed. That is, performance in cued recall was modulated by the number of studied pairs, but not the number of studied individual items. Together, these data suggest that information specific to the pair-type (i.e., associative information) is stored and strategically utilized during memory search.},

memory tasks and place constraints on theoretical development. In four experiments, we
independently manipulated the word frequency and context variability of the targets
(to-be-generated items) and cues in a cued recall paradigm. We found that high frequency
targets were better recalled in both pure and mixed lists, even when context variability
was held constant. High frequency cues were slightly more effective, but this benefit
was eliminated when context variability was held constant. Low context variability cues
were most effective while the context variability of the target had little effect on performance.
The data suggest that words with fewer pre-experimental connections are better
able to isolate the list and that generation of an item from memory benefits from frequency,
perhaps due to the ease of generating common orthographic and phonological features.

Comparison of the perspectives of faculty and their students revealed considerable agreement on the nature, range, and extent of students' UR gains. Specific student gains relating to the process of ``becoming a scientist'' were described and illustrated by both groups. Faculty framed these gains as part of professional socialization into the sciences. In contrast, students emphasized their personal and intellectual development, with little awareness of their socialization into professional practice. Viewing study findings through the lens of social constructivist learning theories demonstrates that the characteristics of these UR programs, how faculty practice UR in these colleges, and students' outcomes---including cognitive and personal growth and the development of a professional identity---strongly exemplify many facets of these theories, particularly, student-centered and situated learning as part of cognitive apprenticeship in a community of practice.},

Experiment 1, dividing attention at study or test decreased old word recognition but did not influence feature and
conjunction recognition errors after correcting for false alarms to new words (baseline). In Experiment 2, a response
deadline manipulation influenced old word recognition but not feature and conjunction effects (i.e., feature
or conjunction error rate minus baseline). Across Experiments 3 and 4, study repetitions increased the probabilities
of feature and conjunction errors for participants under strong pressure to respond quickly. However, no
such increases were observed for participants who were given more time to respond, providing evidence that the
familiarity underlying feature and conjunction errors can be countered with recollection. Thus study repetition increased
both familiarity and recollection. Feature and conjunction errors are based on familiarity in the absence
of recollection. An approach that combines an item--associative distinction with a dual-process framework (e.g.,
Yonelinas, 1997) also can account for these errors. However, an approach that uses a feature-configuration distinction
must be modified to account for these results.},

We also report that reconsolidation and extinction, two opposing processes triggered by memory retrieval, have distinct biochemical signatures: pharmacological antagonism of either cannabinoid receptor 1 or L-type voltage-gated calcium channels blocks extinction but not reconsolidation.

	Abstract = {During the past decade, a large body of research has shown that memory traces can become labile upon retrieval and must be restabilized. Critically, interrupting this reconsolidation process can abolish a previously stable memory. Although a large number of studies have demonstrated this reconsolidation associated amnesia in nonhuman animals, the evidence for its occurrence in humans is far less compelling, especially with regard to declarative memory. In fact, reactivating a declarative memory often makes it more robust and less susceptible to subsequent disruptions. Here we show that existing declarative memories can be selectively impaired by using a noninvasive retrieval--relearning technique. In six experiments, we show that this reconsolidation-associated amnesia can be achieved 48 h after formation of the original memory, but only if relearning occurred soon after retrieval. Furthermore, the amnesic effect persists for at least 24 h, cannot be attributed solely to source confusion and is attainable only when relearning targets specific existing memories for impairment. These results demonstrate that human declarative memory can be selectively rewritten during reconsolidation.},

	Abstract = {Retrieval results in both costs and benefits to episodic memory (Malmberg, Lehman, Annis,
Criss, & Shiffrin, 2014). Output interference (OI) refers to the finding that episodic memory
accuracy decreases with increasing test trials. Release from OI is the restoration of original
accuracy at some point during test. For example, a release from OI in recognition memory
testing occurs when the semantic similarity between stimuli decreases midway through testing
(Malmberg, Criss, Gangwani, & Shiffrin, 2012), suggesting that item representations stored on
early trials cause interference on tests occurring on later trials to the extent that the earlier items
share features with the latter items. In two recognition memory experiments, we demonstrate
release from OI for words and faces. We also test whether release from OI is the result of
interference or is due to a boost in attention caused by reorienting to a novel stimulus type. A test
for the foils presented during the initial test list supports the interference account of OI.

Distortions, such as the misinformation effect or hindsight bias, illustrate that memories can be easily changed, often without their owner taking notice. On the other hand, effects like hypermnesia demonstrate that memory might be more reliable than these distortions suggest. In the neuroscience field, similar observations were obtained mostly from animal studies. Research on memory consolidation suggested that memories become progressively resistant to amnesic treatments over time, but the reconsolidation phenomenon showed that this stability can be transiently lifted when these memories are reactivated, i.e., retrieved. Surprisingly, both research traditions have not taken much notice of each others' advances in understanding memory dynamics. We apply concepts developed in neuroscience to phenomena revealed in cognitive psychology to illustrate how these twins separated at birth may be reunited again.},

	Abstract = {Much recent research has aimed to establish whether visual working memory (WM) is better
characterized by a limited number of discrete all-or-none slots or by a continuous sharing of
memory resources. To date, however, researchers have not considered the response-time (RT)
predictions of discrete-slots versus shared-resources models. To complement the past research in
this field, we formalize a family of mixed-state, discrete-slots models for explaining choice and
RTs in tasks of visual WM change detection. In the tasks under investigation, a small set of visual
items is presented, followed by a test item in 1 of the studied positions for which a change
judgment must be made. According to the models, if the studied item in that position is retained in
1 of the discrete slots, then a memory-based evidence-accumulation process determines the choice
and the RT; if the studied item in that position is missing, then a guessing-based accumulation
process operates. Observed RT distributions are therefore theorized to arise as probabilistic
mixtures of the memory-based and guessing distributions. We formalize an analogous set of
continuous shared-resources models. The model classes are tested on individual subjects with both
qualitative contrasts and quantitative fits to RT-distribution data. The discrete-slots models
provide much better qualitative and quantitative accounts of the RT and choice data than do the
shared-resources models, although there is some evidence for ``slots plus resources'' when memory
set size is very small.},

Prominent candidates in this debate are the unequal-variance signal detection model (UVSD), the dual-process model (DPSD), and two versions of the mixture model (MSD). The present work evaluates a recently proposed ROC-based method for comparing these models (Dede, Squire, & Wixted, Neuropsychologia, 54, 51--56, 2014). This method consists of evaluating the pattern of residuals produced by each model's best fits to ROC data. Previous results showed that the DPSD produced systematic residuals while the UVSD did not, a difference that was interpreted as evidence for the superiority of the latter model. Using a linear mixed model (LMM), we evaluated each model's residuals for 883 individual ROCs. LMM results revealed the presence of systematic residuals in all candidate models, indicating a general failure of these models to capture some of the regularities found in the data. We discuss different ways that current signal detection models can be modified or extended in order to meet the challenge that these systematic residuals represent.},

	Abstract = {In recognition memory, a classic finding is that receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) are curvilinear.
This has been taken to support the fundamental assumptions of signal detection theory (SDT) over
discrete-state models such as the double high-threshold model (2HTM), which predicts linear ROCs.
Recently, however, Br{\"o}der and Schu¨tz (2009) challenged this argument by noting that most of the data
on which support for SDT is based have involved confidence ratings. The authors argued that certain
types of rating scale usage may result in curved ROCs even if the generating process is thresholded in
nature. From this point of view, only ROCs constructed via experimental bias manipulations are useful
for discriminating between the models. Br{\"o}der and Schu¨tz conducted a meta-analysis and new experiments
that compared SDT and the 2HTM using binary (yes--no) ROCs and found that many of these
functions were linear, supporting 2HTM over SDT. We examine all the data reported by Br{\"o}der and
Schu¨tz, noting important limitations in their methodology, analyses, and conclusions. We report a new
meta-analysis and 2 new experiments to examine the issue more closely while avoiding the limitations
of Br{\"o}der and Schu¨tz's study. These new data indicate that binary ROCs are curved in recognition,
consistent with previous findings in perception and reasoning. Our results support classic arguments in
favor of SDT and indicate that curvature in ratings ROCs is not task specific. We recommend the ratings
procedure and suggest that analyses based on threshold models be treated with caution.},

Here, I review the findings that are critical for testing them, including behavioral and brain imaging results of single-item recognition, plurality discrimination, and associative recognition experiments under a variety of testing conditions. I also review the major approaches to measurement and process modeling of recognition. The review indicates that several extant dual-process measures of recollection are unreliable, and thus they are unsuitable as a basis for forming strong conclusions. At the process level, however, the retrieval dynamics of recognition memory and the effect of strengthening operations suggest that a recall-to-reject process plays an important role in plurality discrimination and associative recognition, but not necessarily in single-item recognition. A new theoretical framework proposes that the contribution of recollection to recognition depends on whether the retrieval of episodic details improves accuracy, and it organizes the models around the construct of efficiency. Accordingly, subjects adopt strategies that they believe will produce a desired level of accuracy in the shortest amount of time. Several models derived from this framework are shown to account the accuracy, latency, and confidence with which the various recognition tasks are performed.},

	Abstract = {Model comparison in recognition memory has frequently relied on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) data. We present a meta-analysis of binary-response ROC data that builds on previous such meta-analyses and extends them in several ways. Specifically, we include more data and consider a much more comprehensive set of candidate models. Moreover, we bring to bear modern developments in model selection on the current selection problem. The new methods are based on the minimum description length framework, leading to the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) index for assessing model performance, taking into account differences between the models in flexibility due to functional form. Overall, NML results for individual ROC data indicate a preference for a discrete-state model that assumes a mixture of detection and guessing states.},

	Abstract = {Recent work has reawakened interest in goal-directed or 'model-based' choice, where decisions are based on prospective evaluation of potential action outcomes. Concurrently, there has been growing attention to the role of hierarchy in decision-making and action control. We focus here on the intersection between these two areas of interest, considering the topic of hierarchical model-based control. To characterize this form of action control, we draw on the computational framework of hierarchical reinforcement learning, using this to interpret recent empirical findings. The resulting picture reveals how hierarchical model-based mechanisms might play a special and pivotal role in human decision-making, dramatically extending the scope and complexity of human behaviour.},

	Abstract = {It has been hypothesized that the brain organizes concepts into a mental map, allowing conceptual relationships to be navigated in a manner similar to that of space. Grid cells use a hexagonally symmetric code to organize spatial representations and are the likely source of a precise hexagonal symmetry in the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. Humans navigating conceptual two-dimensional knowledge showed the same hexagonal signal in a set of brain regions markedly similar to those activated during spatial navigation. This gridlike signal is consistent across sessions acquired within an hour and more than a week apart. Our findings suggest that global relational codes may be used to organize nonspatial conceptual representations and that these codes may have a hexagonal gridlike pattern when conceptual knowledge is laid out in two continuous dimensions.},

	Abstract = {Deciphering the neural mechanisms of social behavior has propelled the growth of social neuroscience. The exact computations of the social brain, however, remain elusive. Here we investigated how the human brain tracks ongoing changes in social relationships using functional neuroimaging. Participants were lead characters in a role-playing game in which they were to find a new home and a job through interactions with virtual cartoon characters. We found that a two-dimensional geometric model of social relationships, a "social space" framed by power and affiliation, predicted hippocampal activity. Moreover, participants who reported better social skills showed stronger covariance between hippocampal activity and "movement" through "social space." The results suggest that the hippocampus is crucial for social cognition, and imply that beyond framing physical locations, the hippocampus computes a more general, inclusive, abstract, and multidimensional cognitive map consistent with its role in episodic memory.},

@article{AronEtal17,
	Abstract = {During spatial navigation, neural activity in the hippocampus and the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is correlated to navigational variables such as location, head direction, speed, and proximity to boundaries. These activity patterns are thought to provide a map-like representation of physical space. However, the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit is involved not only in spatial navigation, but also in a variety of memory-guided behaviours. The relationship between this general function and the specialized spatial activity patterns is unclear. A conceptual framework reconciling these views is that spatial representation is just one example of a more general mechanism for encoding continuous, task-relevant variables. Here we tested this idea by recording from hippocampal and entorhinal neurons during a task that required rats to use a joystick to manipulate sound along a continuous frequency axis. We found neural representation of the entire behavioural task, including activity that formed discrete firing fields at particular sound frequencies. Neurons involved in this representation overlapped with the known spatial cell types in the circuit, such as place cells and grid cells. These results suggest that common circuit mechanisms in the hippocampal-entorhinal system are used to represent diverse behavioural tasks, possibly supporting cognitive processes beyond spatial navigation.},

	Abstract = {Grid cells in the brain respond when an animal occupies a periodic lattice of 'grid fields' during navigation. Grids are organized in modules with different periodicity. We propose that the grid system implements a hierarchical code for space that economizes the number of neurons required to encode location with a given resolution across a range equal to the largest period. This theory predicts that (i) grid fields should lie on a triangular lattice, (ii) grid scales should follow a geometric progression, (iii) the ratio between adjacent grid scales should be √e for idealized neurons, and lie between 1.4 and 1.7 for realistic neurons, (iv) the scale ratio should vary modestly within and between animals. These results explain the measured grid structure in rodents. We also predict optimal organization in one and three dimensions, the number of modules, and, with added assumptions, the ratio between grid periods and field widths.},

	Abstract = {What mechanisms support our ability to estimate durations on the order of minutes? Behavioral studies in humans have shown that changes in contextual features lead to overestimation of past durations. Based on evidence that the medial temporal lobes and prefrontal cortex represent contextual features, we related the degree of fMRI pattern change in these regions with people's subsequent duration estimates. After listening to a radio story in the scanner, participants were asked how much time had elapsed between pairs of clips from the story. Our ROI analyses found that duration estimates were correlated with the neural pattern distance between two clips at encoding in the right entorhinal cortex. Moreover, whole-brain searchlight analyses revealed a cluster spanning the right anterior temporal lobe. Our findings provide convergent support for the hypothesis that retrospective time judgments are driven by 'drift' in contextual representations supported by these regions.},

	Abstract = {Context is an important construct in many domains of cognition, including learning, memory, and emotion. We used dynamical systems methods to demonstrate the episodic nature of experience by showing a natural separation between the scales over which within-context and between-context relationships operate. To do this, we represented an individual's emails extending over about 5 years in a high-dimensional semantic space and computed the dimensionalities of the subspaces occupied by these emails. Personal discourse has a two-scaled geometry with smaller within-context dimensionalities than between-context dimensionalities. Prior studies have shown that reading experience (Doxas, Dennis, & Oliver, 2010) and visual experience (Sreekumar, Dennis, Doxas, Zhuang, & Belkin, 2014) have a similar two-scaled structure. Furthermore, the recurrence plot of the emails revealed that experience is predictable and hierarchical, supporting the constructs of some influential theories of memory. The results demonstrate that experience is not scale-free and provide an important target for accounts of how experience shapes cognition.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is necessary for declarative memory in humans and episodic memory in rodents. Considerable current research is focused on the role of plasticity within specific subfields of the hippocampus. Here, using a viral vector to temporally control a focal deletion of the NR1 gene, we show that learning novel paired associations between specific cues and their context is dependent on CA3 NMDA receptors. Deletion of CA3 NR1 genes in <30% of the dorsal hippocampus was sufficient to disrupt new learning, whereas the same treatment does not prevent expression of previously acquired paired associates and does not affect the ability to discriminate contexts or paired associate learning when either the cues or the context is familiar. The findings suggest that CA3 NMDA receptors specifically support the encoding of new experiences to involve incidental and contingent associations.},

	Abstract = {There are a substantial number of studies showing that the orbitofrontal cortex links events to reward values, whereas the hippocampus links events to the context in which they occur. Here we asked how the orbitofrontal cortex contributes to memory where context determines the reward values associated with events. After rats learned object-reward associations that differed depending on the spatial context in which the objects were presented, neuronal ensembles in orbitofrontal cortex represented distinct value-based schemas, each composed of a systematic organization of the representations of objects in the contexts and positions where they were associated with reward or nonreward. Orbitofrontal ensembles also represent the different spatial contexts that define the mappings of stimuli to actions that lead to reward or nonreward. These findings, combined with observations on complementary memory representation within the hippocampus, suggest mechanisms through which prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus interact in support of context-guided memory.},

	Abstract = {A comprehensive picture of object processing in the human brain requires combining both spatial and temporal information about brain activity. Here we acquired human magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to 92 object images. Multivariate pattern classification applied to MEG revealed the time course of object processing: whereas individual images were discriminated by visual representations early, ordinate and superordinate category levels emerged relatively late. Using representational similarity analysis, we combined human fMRI and MEG to show content-specific correspondence between early MEG responses and primary visual cortex (V1), and later MEG responses and inferior temporal (IT) cortex. We identified transient and persistent neural activities during object processing with sources in V1 and IT. Finally, we correlated human MEG signals to single-unit responses in monkey IT. Together, our findings provide an integrated space- and time-resolved view of human object categorization during the first few hundred milliseconds of vision.},

	Abstract = {The dynamics of neural networks is influenced strongly by the spectrum of eigenvalues of the matrix describing their synaptic connectivity. In large networks, elements of the synaptic connectivity matrix can be chosen randomly from appropriate distributions, making results from random matrix theory highly relevant. Unfortunately, classic results on the eigenvalue spectra of random matrices do not apply to synaptic connectivity matrices because of the constraint that individual neurons are either excitatory or inhibitory. Therefore, we compute eigenvalue spectra of large random matrices with excitatory and inhibitory columns drawn from distributions with different means and equal or different variances.},

	Abstract = {A system responding to a stochastic driving signal can be interpreted as computing, by means of its dynamics, an implicit model of the environmental variables. The system's state retains information about past environmental fluctuations, and a fraction of this information is predictive of future ones. The remaining nonpredictive information reflects model complexity that does not improve predictive power, and thus represents the ineffectiveness of the model. We expose the fundamental equivalence between this model inefficiency and thermodynamic inefficiency, measured by dissipation. Our results hold arbitrarily far from thermodynamic equilibrium and are applicable to a wide range of systems, including biomolecular machines. They highlight a profound connection between the effective use of information and efficient thermodynamic operation: any system constructed to keep memory about its environment and to operate with maximal energetic efficiency has to be predictive.},

	Abstract = {Guiding behavior requires the brain to make predictions about the future values of sensory inputs. Here, we show that efficient predictive computation starts at the earliest stages of the visual system. We compute how much information groups of retinal ganglion cells carry about the future state of their visual inputs and show that nearly every cell in the retina participates in a group of cells for which this predictive information is close to the physical limit set by the statistical structure of the inputs themselves. Groups of cells in the retina carry information about the future state of their own activity, and we show that this information can be compressed further and encoded by downstream predictor neurons that exhibit feature selectivity that would support predictive computations. Efficient representation of predictive information is a candidate principle that can be applied at each stage of neural computation.},

	Abstract = {Amnesic patients have a well established deficit in remembering their past experiences. Surprisingly, however, the question as to whether such patients can imagine new experiences has not been formally addressed to our knowledge. We tested whether a group of amnesic patients with primary damage to the hippocampus bilaterally could construct new imagined experiences in response to short verbal cues that outlined a range of simple commonplace scenarios. Our results revealed that patients were markedly impaired relative to matched control subjects at imagining new experiences. Moreover, we identified a possible source for this deficit. The patients' imagined experiences lacked spatial coherence, consisting instead of fragmented images in the absence of a holistic representation of the environmental setting. The hippocampus, therefore, may make a critical contribution to the creation of new experiences by providing the spatial context into which the disparate elements of an experience can be bound. Given how closely imagined experiences match episodic memories, the absence of this function mediated by the hippocampus, may also fundamentally affect the ability to vividly re-experience the past.},

In particular, we investigated whether orienting attention to a spatial location within an array maintained in VSTM could facilitate the search for a specific remembered item. Participants viewed arrays of one, two or four differently colored items, followed by an informative spatial (100% valid) or uninformative neutral retro-cue (1500-2500 ms after the array), and later by a probe stimulus (500-1000 ms after the retro-cue). The task was to decide whether the probe stimulus had been present in the array. Behavioral results showed that spatial retro-cues improved both accuracy and response times for making decisions about the presence of the probe item in VSTM, and significantly attenuated performance decrements caused by increasing VSTM load. We also identified a novel ERP component (N3(RS)) specifically associated with searching for an item within VSTM. Paralleling the behavioral results, the amplitude and duration of the N3(RS) systematically increased with VSTM load in neutral retro-cue trials. When spatial retro-cues were provided, this "retro-search" component was absent. Our findings clearly show that the influence of top-down attentional biases extends to mnemonic functions, and, specifically, that searching for items within VSTM can be under flexible voluntary control.},

	Abstract = {Despite many debates in the first half of the twentieth century, it is now largely a truism that humans and other animals build models of their environments and use them for prediction and control. However, model-based (MB) reasoning presents severe computational challenges. Alternative, computationally simpler, model-free (MF) schemes have been suggested in the reinforcement learning literature, and have afforded influential accounts of behavioural and neural data. Here, we study the realization of MB calculations, and the ways that this might be woven together with MF values and evaluation methods. There are as yet mostly only hints in the literature as to the resulting tapestry, so we offer more preview than review.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have revealed the existence of hippocampal neurons that fire at successive moments in temporally structured experiences. Several studies have shown that such temporal coding is not attributable to external events, specific behaviours or spatial dimensions of an experience. Instead, these cells represent the flow of time in specific memories and have therefore been dubbed 'time cells'. The firing properties of time cells parallel those of hippocampal place cells; time cells thus provide an additional dimension that is integrated with spatial mapping. The robust representation of both time and space in the hippocampus suggests a fundamental mechanism for organizing the elements of experience into coherent memories.},

	Abstract = {Contrary to our rich phenomenological visual experience, our visual short-term memory system can maintain representations of only three to four objects at any given moment. For over a century, the capacity of visual memory has been shown to vary substantially across individuals, ranging from 1.5 to about 5 objects. Although numerous studies have recently begun to characterize the neural substrates of visual memory processes, a neurophysiological index of storage capacity limitations has not yet been established. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for lateralized activity in humans that reflects the encoding and maintenance of items in visual memory. The amplitude of this activity is strongly modulated by the number of objects being held in the memory at the time, but approaches a limit asymptotically for arrays that meet or exceed storage capacity. Indeed, the precise limit is determined by each individual's memory capacity, such that the activity from low-capacity individuals reaches this plateau much sooner than that from high-capacity individuals. Consequently, this measure provides a strong neurophysiological predictor of an individual's capacity, allowing the demonstration of a direct relationship between neural activity and memory capacity.},

	Abstract = {The representation of sound frequency (and of the cochlear partition) within primary auditory cortex has been investigated with use of microelectrode-mapping techniques in a series of 25 anesthetized cats. Among the results were the following: 1) Within vertical penetrations into AI, best frequency and remarkably constant for successively studied neurons across the active middle and deep cortical layers. 2) There is an orderly representation of frequency (and of represented cochlear place) within AI. Frequency is rerepresented across the mediolateral dimension of the field. On an axis perpendicular to this plane of rerepresentation, best-frequency (represented cochlear place) changes as a simple function of cortical location. 3) Any given frequency band (or sector of the cochlear partition) is represented across a belt of cortex of nearly constant width that runs on a nearly straight axis across AI. 4) There is a disproportionately large cortical surface representation of the highest-frequency octaves (basal cochlea) within AI. 5) The primary and secondary field locations were somewhat variable, when referenced to cortical surface landmarks. 6) Data from long penetrations passing down the rostral bank of the posterior ectosylvian sulcus were consistent with the existence of a vertical unit of organization in AI, akin to cortical columns described in primary visual and somatosensory cortex. 7) Responses to tonal stimuli were encountered in fields dorsocaudal, caudal, ventral, and rostral to AI. There is an orderly representation of the cochlea within the field rostal to AI, with a reversal in best frequencies across its border with AI. 8) Physiological definitions of AI boundaries are consistent with their cytoarchitectonic definition. Some of the implications of these findings are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The utilization of symbols such as words and numbers as mental tools endows humans with unrivalled cognitive flexibility. In the number domain, a fundamental first step for the acquisition of numerical symbols is the semantic association of signs with cardinalities. We explored the primitives of such a semantic mapping process by recording single-cell activity in the monkey prefrontal and parietal cortices, brain structures critically involved in numerical cognition. Monkeys were trained to associate visual shapes with varying numbers of items in a matching task. After this long-term learning process, we found that the responses of many prefrontal neurons to the visual shapes reflected the associated numerical value in a behaviorally relevant way. In contrast, such association neurons were rarely found in the parietal lobe. These findings suggest a cardinal role of the prefrontal cortex in establishing semantic associations between signs and abstract categories, a cognitive precursor that may ultimately give rise to symbolic thinking in linguistic humans.},

	Abstract = {Whether cognitive representations are better conceived as language-based, symbolic representations or perceptually related, analog representations is a subject of debate. If cognitive processes parallel perceptual processes, then fundamental psychophysical laws should hold for each. To test this, we analyzed both behavioral and neuronal representations of numerosity in the prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys. The data were best described by a nonlinearly compressed scaling of numerical information, as postulated by the Weber-Fechner law or Stevens' law for psychophysical/sensory magnitudes. This nonlinear compression was observed on the neural level during the acquisition phase of the task and maintained through the memory phase with no further compression. These results suggest that certain cognitive and perceptual/sensory representations share the same fundamental mechanisms and neural coding schemes.},

	Abstract = {How single neurons represent information about the magnitude of a stimulus remains controversial. Neurons encoding purely sensory magnitude typically show monotonic response functions ("summation coding"), and summation units are usually implemented in models of numerosity representation. In contrast, cells representing numerical quantity exhibit nonmonotonic tuning functions that peak at their preferred numerosity ("labeled-line code"), but the restricted range of tested quantities in these studies did not permit a definite answer. Here, we analyzed both behavioral and neuronal representations of a broad range of numerosities from 1 to 30 in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys. Numerosity-selective neurons showed a clear and behaviorally relevant labeled-line code for all numerosities. Moreover, both the behavioral and neuronal tuning functions obeyed the Weber-Fechner Law and were best represented on a nonlinearly compressed scale. Our single-cell study is in good agreement with functional imaging data reporting peaked tuning functions in humans, demonstrating neuronal precursors for human number competence in a nonhuman primate. Our findings also emphasize that the manner in which neurons encode and maintain magnitude information may depend on the precise task at hand as well as the type of magnitude to represent and memorize.},

The animals were immobilized and anesthetized and in each animal 30 to 40 electrode penetrations were typically made over several recording sessions. This area, V2, contains a topographically organized representation of the contralateral visual field up to an eccentricity of at least 80 degrees. The representation of the vertical meridian is adjacent to that in striate cortex (V1) and forms the posterior border of V2. The representation of the horizontal meridian in V2 forms the anterior border of V2 and is split so that the representation of the lower visual field is located dorsally and that of the upper field ventrally. As in V1, the representation of the central visual field is magnified relative to that of the periphery. The area of V2 is slightly smaller than that of V1. At a given eccentricity, receptive field size in V2 is larger than in V1. The myeloarchitecture of V2 is distinguishable from that of the surrounding cortex. The location of V2 corresponds, at least approximately, to that of cytoarchitectonic Area OB. V2 is bordered anteriorly by several other areas containing representations of the visual field.},

	Abstract = {The representation of the visual field in areas V3 and V4 of the macaque was mapped with multiunit electrodes. Twelve Macaca fascicularis were studied in repeated recording sessions while immobilized and anesthetized. V3 is a narrow strip (4-5 mm wide) of myeloarchitectonically distinct cortex located immediately anterior to V2. It contains a systematic representation of the central 35-40 degrees of the contralateral visual field; the representation of the upper quadrant is located ventrally in the hemisphere and that of the lower quadrant, dorsally. There is a small gap between the dorsal (V3d) and ventral (V3v) portions of V3. The representation of the horizontal meridian is adjacent to that in V2 and forms the posterior border of both V3d and V3v. Most or all of the anterior border of V3d consists of the representation of the lower vertical meridian. The entire anterior border of V3v consists of the representation of the upper vertical meridian. V4 is a strip of myeloarchitectonically distinct cortex 5-8 mm wide, immediately anterior to V3. It contains a coarse, but systematic, representation of approximately the central 35-40 degrees of the contralateral visual field. The representation of the upper visual field is located ventrally in the hemisphere. Most of the representation of the lower visual field is located dorsally. The posterior border of V4 corresponds to the representation of the vertical meridian, and the representation of the horizontal meridian is located at or near its anterior border. In both V3 and V4, the representation of the central visual field is magnified relative to that of the periphery. In both areas, the size of receptive fields increases with increasing eccentricity; however, at a given eccentricity, the receptive fields of V4 are larger than those of V3.},

	Abstract = {The human capacity to recognize complex visual patterns emerges in a sequence of brain areas known as the ventral stream, beginning with primary visual cortex (V1). We developed a population model for mid-ventral processing, in which nonlinear combinations of V1 responses are averaged in receptive fields that grow with eccentricity. To test the model, we generated novel forms of visual metamers, stimuli that differ physically but look the same. We developed a behavioral protocol that uses metameric stimuli to estimate the receptive field sizes in which the model features are represented. Because receptive field sizes change along the ventral stream, our behavioral results can identify the visual area corresponding to the representation. Measurements in human observers implicate visual area V2, providing a new functional account of neurons in this area. The model also explains deficits of peripheral vision known as crowding, and provides a quantitative framework for assessing the capabilities and limitations of everyday vision.},

	Abstract = {Effective choices generally require memory, yet little is known regarding the cognitive or neural mechanisms that allow memory to influence choices. We outline a new framework proposing that covert memory processing of hippocampus interacts with action-generation processing of prefrontal cortex in order to arrive at optimal, memory-guided choices. Covert, rapid action-memory simulation (CRAMS) is proposed here as a framework for understanding cognitive and/or behavioral choices, whereby prefrontal-hippocampal interactions quickly provide multiple simulations of potential outcomes used to evaluate the set of possible choices. We hypothesize that this CRAMS process is automatic, obligatory, and covert, meaning that many cycles of action-memory simulation occur in response to choice conflict without an individual's necessary intention and generally without awareness of the simulations, leading to adaptive behavior with little perceived effort. CRAMS is thus distinct from influential proposals that adaptive memory-based behavior in humans requires consciously experienced memory-based construction of possible future scenarios and deliberate decisions among possible future constructions. CRAMS provides an account of why hippocampus has been shown to make critical contributions to the short-term control of behavior, and it motivates several new experimental approaches and hypotheses that could be used to better understand the ubiquitous role of prefrontal-hippocampal interactions in situations that require adaptively using memory to guide choices. Importantly, this framework provides a perspective that allows for testing decision-making mechanisms in a manner that translates well across human and nonhuman animal model systems.},

	Abstract = {Animals respond to changing contingencies to maximize reward. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is important for flexible responding when established contingencies change, but the underlying cognitive mechanisms are debated. We tested rats with sham or OFC lesions in radial maze tasks that varied the frequency of contingency changes and measured both perseverative and non-perseverative errors. When contingencies were changed rarely, rats with sham lesions learned quickly and performed better than rats with OFC lesions. Rats with sham lesions made fewer non-perseverative errors, rarely entering non-rewarded arms, and more win-stay responses by returning to recently rewarded arms compared with rats with OFC lesions. When contingencies were changed rapidly, however, rats with sham lesions learned slower, made more non-perseverative errors and fewer lose-shift responses, and returned more often to non-rewarded arms than rats with OFC lesions. The results support the view that the OFC integrates reward history and suggest that the availability of outcome expectancy signals can either improve or impair adaptive responding depending on reward stability.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is critical for spatial learning and memory. Hippocampal neurons in awake animals exhibit place field activity that encodes current location, as well as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) activity during which representations based on past experiences are often replayed. The relationship between these patterns of activity and the memory functions of the hippocampus is poorly understood. We interrupted awake SWRs in animals learning a spatial alternation task. We observed a specific learning and performance deficit that persisted throughout training. This deficit was associated with awake SWR activity, as SWR interruption left place field activity and post-experience SWR reactivation intact. These results provide a link between awake SWRs and hippocampal memory processes, which suggests that awake replay of memory-related information during SWRs supports learning and memory-guided decision-making.},

@article{SadeEtal15,
	Abstract = {It is well established that performance in free-recall is mediated by an individual's ability to reinstate the study-context during retrieval. This notion is supported by an abundance of evidence and is reflected in prominent models of memory. Introspectively, however, we often feel that a memory just 'pops into mind' and its recall is not accompanied by contextual detail. Here we ask whether this introspection is honored by the cognitive system. Namely, do items one recalls vary in the extent to which their contexts are reinstated? Previous research has provided evidence that indeed recall of some items relies on only little, if any, contextual reinstatement. This evidence pertains to one aspect of context: the concurrent, static encoding context of items, as tapped by the source-memory paradigm. However, because real-life events are strongly embedded in time, it is crucial to also investigate the dynamic, temporal aspects of context. To do so, we capitalized on one of the seminal findings linking recall with temporal-context: the temporal-contiguity effect, whereby the closer two items at study, the higher the probability that they will be retrieved one after the other during test. Using the Remember/Know paradigm, we show that in free-recall, 'Remember' retrievals, which are supposedly accompanied by contextual reinstatement, produce a larger temporal-contiguity effect as compared to 'Know' retrievals. Furthermore, 'Know' retrievals are more likely to be followed by retrieval errors (e.g., intrusions) than 'Remember' retrievals. These findings provide evidence that recalled items vary in the degree to which their temporal-context is reinstated.},

	Abstract = {Reinstatement of neural activity is hypothesized to underlie our ability to mentally travel back in time to recover the context of a previous experience. We used intracranial recordings to directly examine the precise spatiotemporal extent of neural reinstatement as 32 participants with electrodes placed for seizure monitoring performed a paired-associates episodic verbal memory task. By cueing recall, we were able to compare reinstatement during correct and incorrect trials, and found that successful retrieval occurs with reinstatement of a gradually changing neural signal present during encoding. We examined reinstatement in individual frequency bands and individual electrodes and found that neural reinstatement was largely mediated by temporal lobe theta and high-gamma frequencies. Leveraging the high temporal precision afforded by intracranial recordings, our data demonstrate that high-gamma activity associated with reinstatement preceded theta activity during encoding, but during retrieval this difference in timing between frequency bands was absent. Our results build upon previous studies to provide direct evidence that successful retrieval involves the reinstatement of a temporal context, and that such reinstatement occurs with precise spatiotemporal dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Hippocampal damage causes profound yet circumscribed memory impairment across diverse stimulus types and testing formats. Here, within a single test format involving a single class of stimuli, we identified different performance errors to better characterize the specifics of the underlying deficit. The task involved study and reconstruction of object arrays across brief retention intervals. The most striking feature of patients' with hippocampal damage performance was that they tended to reverse the relative positions of item pairs within arrays of any size, effectively "swapping" pairs of objects. These "swap errors" were the primary error type in amnesia, almost never occurred in healthy comparison participants, and actually contributed to poor performance on more traditional metrics (such as distance between studied and reconstructed location). Patients made swap errors even in trials involving only a single pair of objects. The selectivity and severity of this particular deficit creates serious challenges for theories of memory and hippocampus.},

	Abstract = {Functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum (STR) is thought critical for cognition and has been linked to conditions like autism and schizophrenia. We recorded from multiple electrodes in PFC and STR while monkeys acquired new categories. Category learning was accompanied by an increase in beta band synchronization of LFPs between, but not within, the PFC and STR. After learning, different pairs of PFC-STR electrodes showed stronger synchrony for one or the other category, suggesting category-specific functional circuits. This category-specific synchrony was also seen between PFC spikes and STR LFPs, but not the reverse, reflecting the direct monosynaptic connections from the PFC to STR. However, causal connectivity analyses suggested that the polysynaptic connections from STR to the PFC exerted a stronger overall influence. This supports models positing that the basal ganglia "train" the PFC. Category learning may depend on the formation of functional circuits between the PFC and STR.},

	Abstract = {Much of our knowledge of the world depends on learning associations (for example, face-name), for which the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are critical. HPC-PFC interactions have rarely been studied in monkeys, whose cognitive and mnemonic abilities are akin to those of humans. We found functional differences and frequency-specific interactions between HPC and PFC of monkeys learning object pair associations, an animal model of human explicit memory. PFC spiking activity reflected learning in parallel with behavioral performance, whereas HPC neurons reflected feedback about whether trial-and-error guesses were correct or incorrect. Theta-band HPC-PFC synchrony was stronger after errors, was driven primarily by PFC to HPC directional influences and decreased with learning. In contrast, alpha/beta-band synchrony was stronger after correct trials, was driven more by HPC and increased with learning. Rapid object associative learning may occur in PFC, whereas HPC may guide neocortical plasticity by signaling success or failure via oscillatory synchrony in different frequency bands.},

	Abstract = {Place-modulated activity among neurons in the hippocampal formation presents a means to organize contextual information in the service of memory formation and recall. One particular spatial representation, that of grid cells, has been observed in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of rats and bats, but has yet to be described in single units in primates. Here we examined spatial representations in the EC of head-fixed monkeys performing a free-viewing visual memory task. Individual neurons were identified in the primate EC that emitted action potentials when the monkey fixated multiple discrete locations in the visual field in each of many sequentially presented complex images. These firing fields possessed spatial periodicity similar to a triangular tiling with a corresponding well-defined hexagonal structure in the spatial autocorrelation. Further, these neurons showed theta-band oscillatory activity and changing spatial scale as a function of distance from the rhinal sulcus, which is consistent with previous findings in rodents. These spatial representations may provide a framework to anchor the encoding of stimulus content in a complex visual scene. Together, our results provide a direct demonstration of grid cells in the primate and suggest that EC neurons encode space during visual exploration, even without locomotion.},

	Abstract = {Exploratory behaviors during learning determine what is studied and when, helping to optimize subsequent memory performance. To elucidate the cognitive and neural determinants of exploratory behaviors, we manipulated the control that human subjects had over the position of a moving window through which they studied objects and their locations. Our behavioral, neuropsychological and neuroimaging data indicate that volitional control benefits memory performance and is linked to a brain network that is centered on the hippocampus. Increases in correlated activity between the hippocampus and other areas were associated with specific aspects of memory, which suggests that volitional control optimizes interactions among specialized neural systems through the hippocampus. Memory is therefore an active process that is intrinsically linked to behavior. Furthermore, brain structures that are typically seen as passive participants in memory encoding (for example, the hippocampus) are actually part of an active network that controls behavior dynamically as it unfolds.},

	Abstract = {Effective exploratory behaviors involve continuous updating of sensory sampling to optimize the efficacy of information gathering. Despite some work on this issue in animals, little information exists regarding the cognitive or neural mechanisms for this sort of behavioral optimization in humans. Here we examined a visual exploration phenomenon that occurred when human subjects studying an array of objects spontaneously looked "backward" in their scanning paths to view recently seen objects again. This "spontaneous revisitation" of recently viewed objects was associated with enhanced hippocampal activity and superior subsequent memory performance in healthy participants, but occurred only rarely in amnesic patients with severe damage to the hippocampus. These findings demonstrate the necessity of the hippocampus not just in the aspects of long-term memory with which it has been associated previously, but also in the short-term adaptive control of behavior. Functional neuroimaging showed hippocampal engagement occurring in conjunction with frontocerebellar circuits, thereby revealing some of the larger brain circuitry essential for the strategic deployment of information-seeking behaviors that optimize learning.},

	Abstract = {Animals can learn causal relationships between pairs of stimuli separated in time and this ability depends on the hippocampus. Such learning is believed to emerge from alterations in network connectivity, but large-scale connectivity is difficult to measure directly, especially during learning. Here, we show that area CA1 cells converge to time-locked firing sequences that bridge the two stimuli paired during training, and this phenomenon is coupled to a reorganization of network correlations. Using two-photon calcium imaging of mouse hippocampal neurons we find that co-time-tuned neurons exhibit enhanced spontaneous activity correlations that increase just prior to learning. While time-tuned cells are not spatially organized, spontaneously correlated cells do fall into distinct spatial clusters that change as a result of learning. We propose that the spatial re-organization of correlation clusters reflects global network connectivity changes that are responsible for the emergence of the sequentially-timed activity of cell-groups underlying the learned behavior.

	Abstract = {The topographic organization of striate cortex in the macaque was studied using physiological recording techniques. Results were displayed on two-dimensional maps of the cortex, which facilitated the quantitative analysis of various features of the visual representation. The representation was found to be asymmetric with more cortex devoted to lower than to upper fields. Over much of striate cortex the representation is anisotropic, in that the magnification factor depends upon the direction along which it is measured. There is considerable individual variability in these features as well as in the overall size of striate cortex. Outside the fovea, the cortical representation shows only modest deviations from a logarithmic conformal mapping, in which the magnification factor is proportional to the inverse of eccentricity in the visual field. Comparison of receptive field size with cortical magnification was used to estimate the "point image size" in the cortex (i.e. the extent of cortex concerned with processing inputs from any given point in the visual field). Our evidence supports a previous report that point-image size varies significantly with eccentricity. This is of interest in relation to anatomical evidence that the dimensions of columnar systems in striate cortex are largely independent of eccentricity.},

	Abstract = {The human memory system is remarkable in its capacity to focus its search on items learned in a given context. This capacity can be so precise that many leading models of human memory assume that only those items learned in the context of a recently studied list compete for recall. We sought to extend the explanatory scope of these models to include not only intralist phenomena, such as primacy and recency effects, but also interlist phenomena such as proactive and retroactive interference. Building on retrieved temporal context models of memory search (e.g., Polyn, Norman, & Kahana, 2009), we present a substantially revised theory in which memory accumulates across multiple experimental lists, and temporal context is used both to focus retrieval on a target list, and to censor retrieved information when its match to the current context indicates that it was learned in a nontarget list. We show how the resulting model can simultaneously account for a wide range of intralist and interlist phenomena, including the pattern of prior-list intrusions observed in free recall, build-up of and release from proactive interference, and the ability to selectively target retrieval of items on specific prior lists (Jang & Huber, 2008; Shiffrin, 1970). In a new experiment, we verify that subjects' error monitoring processes are consistent with those predicted by the model. (PsycINFO Database Record},

	Abstract = {Recent advancements in Bayesian modeling have allowed for likelihood-free posterior estimation. Such estimation techniques are crucial to the understanding of simulation-based models, whose likelihood functions may be difficult or even impossible to derive. However, current approaches are limited by their dependence on sufficient statistics and/or tolerance thresholds. In this article, we provide a new approach that requires no summary statistics, error terms, or thresholds and is generalizable to all models in psychology that can be simulated. We use our algorithm to fit a variety of cognitive models with known likelihood functions to ensure the accuracy of our approach. We then apply our method to two real-world examples to illustrate the types of complex problems our method solves. In the first example, we fit an error-correcting criterion model of signal detection, whose criterion dynamically adjusts after every trial. We then fit two models of choice response time to experimental data: the linear ballistic accumulator model, which has a known likelihood, and the leaky competing accumulator model, whose likelihood is intractable. The estimated posterior distributions of the two models allow for direct parameter interpretation and model comparison by means of conventional Bayesian statistics-a feat that was not previously possible.},

@article{TurnEtal13,
	Abstract = {Bayesian estimation has played a pivotal role in the understanding of individual differences. However, for many models in psychology, Bayesian estimation of model parameters can be difficult. One reason for this difficulty is that conventional sampling algorithms, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), can be inefficient and impractical when little is known about the target distribution--particularly the target distribution's covariance structure. In this article, we highlight some reasons for this inefficiency and advocate the use of a population MCMC algorithm, called differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo (DE-MCMC), as a means of efficient proposal generation. We demonstrate in a simulation study that the performance of the DE-MCMC algorithm is unaffected by the correlation of the target distribution, whereas conventional MCMC performs substantially worse as the correlation increases. We then show that the DE-MCMC algorithm can be used to efficiently fit a hierarchical version of the linear ballistic accumulator model to response time data, which has proven to be a difficult task when conventional MCMC is used.},

	Abstract = {Neural correlates of visual categories have been previously identified in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, whether individual neurons can represent multiple categories is unknown. Varying degrees of generalization versus specialization of neurons in the PFC have been theorized. We recorded from lateral PFC neural activity while monkeys switched between two different and independent categorical distinctions (Cats versus Dogs, Sports Cars versus Sedans). We found that many PFC neurons reflected both categorical distinctions. In fact, these multitasking neurons had the strongest category effects. This stands in contrast to our lab's recent report that monkeys switching between competing categorical distinctions (applied to the same stimulus set) showed independent representations. We suggest that cognitive demands determine whether PFC neurons function as category "multitaskers."},

	Abstract = {The hippocampal CA2 subregion has a different anatomical connectivity pattern within the entorhino-hippocampal circuit than either the CA1 or CA3 subregion. Yet major differences in the neuronal activity patterns of CA2 compared with the other CA subregions have not been reported. We show that standard spatial and temporal firing patterns of individual hippocampal principal neurons in behaving rats, such as place fields, theta modulation, and phase precession, are also present in CA2, but that the CA2 subregion differs substantially from the other CA subregions in its population coding. CA2 ensembles do not show a persistent code for space or for differences in context. Rather, CA2 activity patterns become progressively dissimilar over time periods of hours to days. The weak coding for a particular context is consistent with recent behavioral evidence that CA2 circuits preferentially support social, emotional, and temporal rather than spatial aspects of memory.},

	Abstract = {Making sense of previous experience requires remembering the order in which events unfolded in time. Prior work has implicated the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe cortex in memory for temporal information associated with individual episodes. However, the processes involved in encoding and retrieving temporal information across extended sequences is relatively poorly understood. Here we used fMRI during the encoding and retrieval of extended sequences to test specific predictions about the type of information used to resolve temporal order and the role of the hippocampus in this process. Participants studied sequences of images of celebrity faces and common objects followed by a recency discrimination test. The main conditions of interest were pairs of items that had been presented with three intervening items, half of which included an intervening category shift. During encoding, hippocampal pattern similarity across intervening items was associated with subsequent successful order memory. To test for evidence of associative retrieval, we trained a classifier to discriminate encoding patterns associated with faces versus objects and applied the classifier on fMRI patterns during recency discrimination. We found evidence that the category content of intervening items was reactivated during recency judgments, and this was related to hippocampal encoding-retrieval similarity. A follow-up behavioral priming experiment revealed additional evidence for intervening item reinstatement during temporal order judgments. Reinstatement did not differ according to whether the items occurred within a single context or across context boundaries. Thus, these data suggest that inter-item associative encoding and retrieval mediated by the hippocampus contribute to temporal order memory.},

@article{SchmDiba09,
	Abstract = {During the crossing of the place field of a pyramidal cell in the rat hippocampus, the firing phase of the cell decreases with respect to the local theta rhythm. This phase precession is usually studied on the basis of data in which many place field traversals are pooled together. Here we study properties of phase precession in single trials. We found that single-trial and pooled-trial phase precession were different with respect to phase-position correlation, phase-time correlation, and phase range. Whereas pooled-trial phase precession may span 360 degrees , the most frequent single-trial phase range was only approximately 180 degrees. In pooled trials, the correlation between phase and position (r = -0.58) was stronger than the correlation between phase and time (r = -0.27), whereas in single trials these correlations (r = -0.61 for both) were not significantly different. Next, we demonstrated that phase precession exhibited a large trial-to-trial variability. Overall, only a small fraction of the trial-to-trial variability in measures of phase precession (e.g., slope or offset) could be explained by other single-trial properties (such as running speed or firing rate), whereas the larger part of the variability remains to be explained. Finally, we found that surrogate single trials, created by randomly drawing spikes from the pooled data, are not equivalent to experimental single trials: pooling over trials therefore changes basic measures of phase precession. These findings indicate that single trials may be better suited for encoding temporally structured events than is suggested by the pooled data.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental question in neuroscience concerns how the human brain represents perceptual and conceptual information. Traditionally, researchers probed this issue by identifying single neurons that increased their firing rate when an animal encountered certain stimuli. Here we provide evidence of a complementary scheme in which gamma-band (25-128 Hz) electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity -- a phenomenon involving large groups of neurons -- encodes the active cognitive representation. We analyzed intracranial brain recordings from neurosurgical patients while they studied lists of visually presented letters and found that the amplitude of gamma-band activity encoded the identity of the current letter. These letter-specific patterns occurred during periods of overall increased gamma amplitude and were linked to the phase of simultaneous theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations. In occipital cortex, these patterns sometimes reflected the shape of the viewed letter, but, in other brain regions, this phenomenon was not related to letter form. Our findings show that gamma-band activity encodes a range of perceptual and conceptual information, suggesting that ECoG recordings can reveal neural correlates of specific human cognitive representations.},

	Abstract = {A topographical relationship exists between the hippocampus-entorhinal cortex and the neocortex. However, it is not known how these anatomical connections are utilized during information exchange and behavior. We recorded theta oscillations along the entire extent of the septotemporal axis of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal layer. While the frequency of theta oscillation remained same along the entire long axis, the amplitude and coherence between recording sites decreased from dorsal to ventral hippocampus (VH). Theta phase shifted monotonically with distance along the longitudinal axis, reaching ∼180$\,^{\circ}$ between the septal and temporal poles. The majority of concurrently recorded units were phase-locked to the local field theta at all dorsoventral segments. The power of VH theta had only a weak correlation with locomotion velocity, and its amplitude varied largely independently from theta in the dorsal part. Thus, theta oscillations can temporally combine or segregate neocortical representations along the septotemporal axis of the hippocampus.},

	Abstract = {A growing number of researchers use descriptive distributions such as the ex-Gaussian and the shifted Wald to summarize response time data for speeded two-choice tasks. Some of these researchers also assume that the parameters of these distributions uniquely correspond to specific cognitive processes. We studied the validity of this cognitive interpretation by relating the parameters of the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald distributions to those of the Ratcliff diffusion model, a successful model whose parameters have well-established cognitive interpretations. In a simulation study, we fitted the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald distributions to data generated from the diffusion model by systematically varying its parameters across a wide range of plausible values. In an empirical study, the two descriptive distributions were fitted to published data that featured manipulations of task difficulty, response caution, and a priori bias. The results clearly demonstrate that the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald parameters do not correspond uniquely to parameters of the diffusion model. We conclude that researchers should resist the temptation to interpret changes in the ex-Gaussian and shifted Wald parameters in terms of cognitive processes.

	Abstract = {We propose a linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model of decision making and reaction time. The LBA is simpler than other models of choice response time, with independent accumulators that race towards a common response threshold. Activity in the accumulators increases in a linear and deterministic manner. The simplicity of the model allows complete analytic solutions for choices between any number of alternatives. These solutions (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from five previously published experiments, we demonstrate that the LBA model successfully accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks that have proven difficult for other theoretical accounts. Our results are encouraging in a field beset by the tradeoff between complexity and completeness.},

	Abstract = {Neuropsychological studies have recently demonstrated that the macaque monkey perirhinal (areas 35 and 36) and parahippocampal (areas TH and TF) cortices contribute importantly to normal memory function. Unfortunately, neuroanatomical information concerning the cytoarchitectonic organization and extrinsic connectivity of these cortical regions is meager. We investigated the organization of cortical inputs to the macaque monkey perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices by placing discrete injections of the retrograde tracers fast blue, diamidino yellow, and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase throughout these areas. We found that the macaque monkey perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices receive different complements of cortical inputs. The major cortical inputs to the perirhinal cortex arise from the unimodal visual areas TE and rostral TEO and from area TF of the parahippocampal cortex. The perirhinal cortex also receives projections from the dysgranular and granular subdivisions of the insular cortex and from area 13 of the orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, area TF of the parahippocampal cortex receives its strongest input from more caudal visual areas V4, TEO, and caudal TE, as well as prominent inputs from polymodal association cortices, including the retrosplenial cortex and the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Area TF also receives projections from areas 7a and LIP of the posterior parietal lobe, insular cortex, and areas 46, 13, 45, and 9 of the frontal lobe. As with area TF, area TH receives substantial projections from the retrosplenial cortex as well as moderate projections from the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus; unlike area TF, area TH receives almost no innervation from areas TE and TEO. It does, however, receive relatively strong inputs from auditory association areas on the convexity of the superior temporal gyrus.},

	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: Recent evidence suggests that the hippocampus may integrate overlapping memories into relational representations, or schemas, that link indirectly related events and support flexible memory expression. Here we explored the nature of hippocampal neural population representations for multiple features of events and the locations and contexts in which they occurred. Hippocampal networks developed hierarchical organizations of associated elements of related but separately acquired memories within a context, and distinct organizations for memories where the contexts differentiated object-reward associations. These findings reveal neural mechanisms for the development and organization of relational representations.

	Abstract = {In Experiments 1 and 2, monkeys received 3-stage operations intended to serially disconnect parieto-preoccipital from striate cortex. At each stage (unilateral parieto-preoccipital removal, contralateral striate removal and posterior callosal transection) the monkeys were tested for retention of the landmark task, a visuospatial discrimination sensitive to the effects of bilateral parieto-preoccipital damage. To check the effectiveness of the disconnection, the monkeys were also tested after removal of the remaining parieto-preoccipital cortex. The results demonstrated that corticocortical inputs from striate cortex are crucial for the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex, just as they had been shown earlier to be crucial for the pattern discrimination functions of inferior temporal cortex. Relative to inferior temporal cortex, however, parieto-preoccipital cortex was found to be especially dependent on ipsilateral (as compared with contralateral) striate inputs. In Experiment 3, monkeys received bilateral lesions of either lateral on medial striate cortex and were tested on both a pattern discrimination task, to assess residual inferior temporal function, and the landmark task, to assess residual parieto-preoccipital function. The results indicated that the pattern discrimination functions of inferior temporal cortex are especially dependent on inputs from lateral striate cortex, whereas the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex are equally dependent on inputs from lateral and medial striate cortex. The relatively greater contribution to parieto-preoccipital than to inferior temporal cortex made by ipsilateral and medial striate inputs (representing contralateral and peripheral visual fields, respectively) can also be seen in the receptive field properties of parieto-preoccipital and inferior temporal neurons. The differences in the organization of striate inputs to these two cortical association areas presumably reflect differences in the processing required for spatial vs object vision.},

	Abstract = {Recent functional imaging work supports the view that item and relational memory depend upon distinct encoding operations within the medial temporal lobe. Specifically, emerging findings demonstrate that the level of engagement of perirhinal cortex predicts later memory for individual items, whereas the level of hippocampal processing correlates with later relational memory, or recovery of additional episodic details. Furthermore, recent functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence in humans suggests that medial temporal lobe cortical input structures, the perirhinal and posterior parahippocampal cortices, differentially participate in the encoding of objects and their context, providing domain-specific input to the hippocampus. Taken together, these data help to construct a working model of how distinct medial temporal lobe structures participate in episodic memory formation with domain-general relational binding mechanisms supported by the hippocampus and provide emerging evidence for domain-specificity within the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices.},

@article{BurwAmar98,
	Abstract = {We have divided the cortical regions surrounding the rat hippocampus into three cytoarchitectonically discrete cortical regions, the perirhinal, the postrhinal, and the entorhinal cortices. These regions appear to be homologous to the monkey perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices, respectively. The origin of cortical afferents to these regions is well-documented in the monkey but less is known about them in the rat. The present study investigated the origins of cortical input to the rat perirhinal (areas 35 and 36) and postrhinal cortices and the lateral and medial subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex (LEA and MEA) by placing injections of retrograde tracers at several locations within each region. For each experiment, the total numbers of retrogradely labeled cells (and cell densities) were estimated for 34 cortical regions. We found that the complement of cortical inputs differs for each of the five regions. Area 35 receives its heaviest input from entorhinal, piriform, and insular areas. Area 36 receives its heaviest projections from other temporal cortical regions such as ventral temporal association cortex. Area 36 also receives substantial input from insular and entorhinal areas. Whereas area 36 receives similar magnitudes of input from cortices subserving all sensory modalities, the heaviest projections to the postrhinal cortex originate in visual associational cortex and visuospatial areas such as the posterior parietal cortex. The cortical projections to the LEA are heavier than to the MEA and differ in origin. The LEA is primarily innervated by the perirhinal, insular, piriform, and postrhinal cortices. The MEA is primarily innervated by the piriform and postrhinal cortices, but also receives minor projections from retrosplenial, posterior parietal, and visual association areas.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.},

	Abstract = {More than three decades of research have demonstrated a role for hippocampal place cells in representation of the spatial environment in the brain. New studies have shown that place cells are part of a broader circuit for dynamic representation of self-location. A key component of this network is the entorhinal grid cells, which, by virtue of their tessellating firing fields, may provide the elements of a path integration-based neural map. Here we review how place cells and grid cells may form the basis for quantitative spatiotemporal representation of places, routes, and associated experiences during behavior and in memory. Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.},

Theoretical studies, in conjunction with recent empirical discoveries, suggest that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) might perform some of the essential underlying computations by means of a unique, periodic synaptic matrix that could be self-organized in early development through a simple, symmetry-breaking operation. The scale at which space is represented increases systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC, apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed signal. Convergence of spatially periodic input at multiple scales, from so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, might result in non-periodic spatial firing patterns (place fields) in the hippocampus.},

	Abstract = {It is currently not known how distributed neuronal responses in early visual areas carry stimulus-related information. We made multielectrode recordings from cat primary visual cortex and applied methods from machine learning in order to analyze the temporal evolution of stimulus-related information in the spiking activity of large ensembles of around 100 neurons. We used sequences of up to three different visual stimuli (letters of the alphabet) presented for 100 ms and with intervals of 100 ms or larger. Most of the information about visual stimuli extractable by sophisticated methods of machine learning, i.e., support vector machines with nonlinear kernel functions, was also extractable by simple linear classification such as can be achieved by individual neurons. New stimuli did not erase information about previous stimuli. The responses to the most recent stimulus contained about equal amounts of information about both this and the preceding stimulus. This information was encoded both in the discharge rates (response amplitudes) of the ensemble of neurons and, when using short time constants for integration (e.g., 20 ms), in the precise timing of individual spikes (<or= approximately 20 ms), and persisted for several 100 ms beyond the offset of stimuli. The results indicate that the network from which we recorded is endowed with fading memory and is capable of performing online computations utilizing information about temporally sequential stimuli. This result challenges models assuming frame-by-frame analyses of sequential inputs.},

	Abstract = {A correlation dimension analysis of people's visual experiential streams captured by a smartphone shows that visual experience is two-scaled with a smaller dimension at shorter length scales than at longer length scales. The bend between the two scales is a phase transition point where the lower scale primarily captures relationships within the same context and the higher dimensional scale captures relationships between different contexts. The dimensionality estimates are confirmed using Takens' delay embedding procedure on the image stream, while the randomly permuted stream is shown to be space-filling thereby establishing that the two-scaled structure is a consequence of the dynamics. We note that the structure of visual experience closely resembles the structure of another domain of experience: natural language discourse. The emergence of an identical structure across different domains of human experience suggests that the two-scaled geometry reflects a general organizational principle.},

We have previously described a theoretical framework that explains how temporal representations, similar to those reported in the visual cortex, can form in locally recurrent cortical networks as a function of reward modulated synaptic plasticity. This framework allows networks of both linear and spiking neurons to learn the temporal interval between a stimulus and paired reward signal presented during training. Here we use a mean field approach to analyze the dynamics of non-linear stochastic spiking neurons in a network trained to encode specific time intervals. This analysis explains how recurrent excitatory feedback allows a network structure to encode temporal representations.},

	Abstract = {The ability to represent interval timing is crucial for many common behaviors, such as knowing whether to stop when the light turns from green to yellow. Neural representations of interval timing have been reported in the rat primary visual cortex and we have previously presented a computational framework describing how they can be learned by a network of neurons. Recent experimental and theoretical results in entorhinal cortex have shown that single neurons can exhibit persistent activity, previously thought to be generated by a network of neurons. Motivated by these single neuron results, we propose a single spiking neuron model that can learn to compute and represent interval timing. We show that a simple model, reduced analytically to a single dynamical equation, captures the average behavior of the complete high dimensional spiking model very well. Variants of this model can be used to produce bi-stable or multi-stable persistent activity. We also propose a plasticity rule by which this model can learn to represent different intervals and different levels of persistent activity.},

	Abstract = {Single-neuron recordings from behaving primates have established a link between working memory processes and information-specific neuronal persistent activity in the prefrontal cortex. Using a network model endowed with a columnar architecture and based on the physiological properties of cortical neurons and synapses, we have examined the synaptic mechanisms of selective persistent activity underlying spatial working memory in the prefrontal cortex. Our model reproduces the phenomenology of the oculomotor delayed-response experiment of Funahashi et al. (S. Funahashi, C.J. Bruce and P.S. Goldman-Rakic, Mnemonic coding of visual space in the monkey's dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. J Neurophysiol 61:331-349, 1989). To observe stable spontaneous and persistent activity, we find that recurrent synaptic excitation should be primarily mediated by NMDA receptors, and that overall recurrent synaptic interactions should be dominated by inhibition. Isodirectional tuning of adjacent pyramidal cells and interneurons can be accounted for by a structured pyramid-to-interneuron connectivity. Robust memory storage against random drift of the tuned persistent activity and against distractors (intervening stimuli during the delay period) may be enhanced by neuromodulation of recurrent synapses. Experimentally testable predictions concerning the neural basis of working memory are discussed.},

Here, we describe an automated sorting procedure that combines independent component analysis and image segmentation for extracting cells' locations and their dynamics with minimal human supervision. In validation studies using simulated data, automated sorting significantly improved estimation of cellular signals compared to conventional analysis based on image regions of interest. We used automated procedures to analyze data recorded by two-photon Ca(2+) imaging in the cerebellar vermis of awake behaving mice. Our analysis yielded simultaneous Ca(2+) activity traces for up to >100 Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia from single recordings. Using this approach, we found microzones of Purkinje cells that were stable across behavioral states and in which synchronous Ca(2+) spiking rose significantly during locomotion.},

	Abstract = {Memory enables flexible use of past experience to inform new behaviors. Though leading theories hypothesize that this fundamental flexibility results from the formation of integrated memory networks relating multiple experiences, the neural mechanisms that support memory integration are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that retrieval-mediated learning, whereby prior event details are reinstated during encoding of related experiences, supports participants' ability to infer relationships between distinct events that share content. Furthermore, we show that activation changes in a functionally coupled hippocampal and ventral medial prefrontal cortical circuit track the formation of integrated memories and successful inferential memory performance. These findings characterize the respective roles of these regions in retrieval-mediated learning processes that support relational memory network formation and inferential memory in the human brain. More broadly, these data reveal fundamental mechanisms through which memory representations are constructed into prospectively useful formats.
HIGHLIGHTS
* Shared content across experiences triggers reactivation of overlapping memories
* Anterior medial temporal lobe cortex tracks fidelity of retrieval during encoding
* Hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex interact to integrate related events
* Retrieval-mediated memory integration enables inference across experiences},

	Abstract = {The hippocampal formation is suggested to be crucial in unambiguous representation of overlapping temporal sequences in episodic memory. We hypothesized that, if this was true, the hippocampal formation neurons would differentially respond to the same elements even in different temporal sequences. The present study was designed to investigate hippocampal formation CA1 neuronal activity of rats during performance of a conditional delayed stimulus-response association task in which three stimuli were conditionally and serially presented with a delay. In the task, the pairs of the second and third stimuli were overlapped across the trials, but separated by the preceding first stimuli. Conditioned tones coming from one of three possible directions were followed, after a short delay, by one of three pairs of reinforcement series. The pairs consisted of air puff (aversive sensory stimuli) and tube protrusion (which allowed licking sucrose behavior) in the following combinations: air puff-tube protrusion, tube protrusion-tube protrusion and tube protrusion-air puff. The pairs were interposed by a 2 s delay. The three conditioned tone directions were associated with these three pairs in a one-to-one correspondence, and its association was conditional to three possible conditioned tone frequencies (300, 530, and 1,200 Hz). The responses of 107 neurons to the air puff and tube protrusion were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (task condition x reinforcement situation). Of 42 air puff-responsive and 64 tube protrusion-responsive neurons, 36 and 53 displayed significant main effects and/or significant interaction, respectively. Furthermore, neural responses during the delay periods were dependent on the task conditions. The results indicated that the majority of the hippocampal formation neurons showed task condition- and/or reinforcement situation-dependent responses, suggesting a crucial role of the hippocampal formation in representation of overlapping serial events in episodic memory.},

	Abstract = {Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

	Abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.},

	Abstract = {Scaling laws are ubiquitous in nature, and they pervade neural, behavioral and linguistic activities. A scaling law suggests the existence of processes or patterns that are repeated across scales of analysis. Although the variables that express a scaling law can vary from one type of activity to the next, the recurrence of scaling laws across so many different systems has prompted a search for unifying principles. In biological systems, scaling laws can reflect adaptive processes of various types and are often linked to complex systems poised near critical points. The same is true for perception, memory, language and other cognitive phenomena. Findings of scaling laws in cognitive science are indicative of scaling invariance in cognitive mechanisms and multiplicative interactions among interdependent components of cognition.},

	Abstract = {The complexity of human interactions with social and natural phenomena is mirrored in the way we describe our experiences through natural language. In order to retain and convey such a high dimensional information, the statistical properties of our linguistic output has to be highly correlated in time. An example are the robust observations, still largely not understood, of correlations on arbitrary long scales in literary texts. In this paper we explain how long-range correlations flow from highly structured linguistic levels down to the building blocks of a text (words, letters, etc..). By combining calculations and data analysis we show that correlations take form of a bursty sequence of events once we approach the semantically relevant topics of the text. The mechanisms we identify are fairly general and can be equally applied to other hierarchical settings.},

We sought to identify brain regions that accumulate information over short and long timescales and to characterize the distinguishing features of their dynamics. We recorded electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals from individuals watching intact and scrambled movies. Within sensory regions, fluctuations of high-frequency (64-200 Hz) power reliably tracked instantaneous low-level properties of the intact and scrambled movies. Within higher order regions, the power fluctuations were more reliable for the intact movie than the scrambled movie, indicating that these regions accumulate information over relatively long time periods (several seconds or longer). Slow (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations of high-frequency power with time courses locked to the movies were observed throughout the cortex. Slow fluctuations were relatively larger in regions that accumulated information over longer time periods, suggesting a connection between slow neuronal population dynamics and temporally extended information processing.},

	Abstract = {We use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze neural responses to natural auditory stimuli. We characterize the fMRI time series through the shape of the voxel power spectrum and find that the timescales of neural dynamics vary along a spatial gradient, with faster dynamics in early auditory cortex and slower dynamics in higher order brain regions. The timescale gradient is observed through the unsupervised clustering of the power spectra of individual brains, both in the presence and absence of a stimulus, and is enhanced in the stimulus-locked component that is shared across listeners. Moreover, intrinsically faster dynamics occur in areas that respond preferentially to momentary stimulus features, while the intrinsically slower dynamics occur in areas that integrate stimulus information over longer timescales. These observations connect the timescales of intrinsic neural dynamics to the timescales of information processing, suggesting a temporal organizing principle for neural computation across the cerebral cortex.},

	Abstract = {The article tests the assumption that forgetting in working memory for verbal materials is caused by time-based decay, using the complex-span paradigm. Participants encoded 6 letters for serial recall; each letter was preceded and followed by a processing period comprising 4 trials of difficult visual search. Processing duration, during which memory could decay, was manipulated via search set size. This manipulation increased retention interval by up to 100% without having any effect on recall accuracy. This result held with and without articulatory suppression. Two experiments using a dual-task paradigm showed that the visual search process required central attention. Thus, even when memory maintenance by central attention and by articulatory rehearsal was prevented, a large delay had no effect on memory performance, contrary to the decay notion. Most previous experiments that manipulated the retention interval and the opportunity for maintenance processes in complex span have confounded these variables with time pressure during processing periods. Three further experiments identified time pressure as the variable that affected recall. We conclude that time-based decay does not contribute to the capacity limit of verbal working memory.},

	Abstract = {We provide an "executive-attention" framework for organizing the cognitive neuroscience research on the constructs of working-memory capacity (WMC), general fluid intelligence, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) function. Rather than provide a novel theory of PFC function, we synthesize a wealth of single-cell, brain-imaging, and neuropsychological research through the lens of our theory of normal individual differences in WMC and attention control (Engle, Kane, & Tuholski, 1999; Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, & Conway, 1999). Our critical review confirms the prevalent view that dorsolateral PFC circuitry is critical to executive-attention functions. Moreover, although the dorsolateral PFC is but one critical structure in a network of anterior and posterior "attention control" areas, it does have a unique executive-attention role in actively maintaining access to stimulus representations and goals in interference-rich contexts. Our review suggests the utility of an executive-attention framework for guiding future research on both PFC function and cognitive control.},

	Abstract = {According to the retrieved context theory of episodic memory, the cue for recall of an item is a weighted sum of recently activated cognitive states, including previously recalled and studied items as well as their associations. We show that this theory predicts there should be compound cuing in free recall. Specifically, the temporal contiguity effect should be greater when the 2 most recently recalled items were studied in contiguous list positions. A meta-analysis of published free recall experiments demonstrates evidence for compound cuing in both conditional response probabilities and interresponse times. To help rule out a rehearsal-based account of these compound cuing effects, we conducted an experiment with immediate, delayed, and continual-distractor free recall conditions. Consistent with retrieved context theory but not with a rehearsal-based account, compound cuing was present in all conditions, and was not significantly influenced by the presence of interitem distractors.},

	Abstract = {In order to parse the causal elements underlying complex behaviors and decision-making processes, appropriate behavioral methods must be developed and used in concurrence with molecular, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches. Presented is a protocol for a novel Go/No-Go behavioral paradigm to study the brain attention and motivation/reward circuitry in awake, head-restrained rodents. This experimental setup allows: (1) Pharmacological and viral manipulation of various brain regions via targeted guide cannula; (2) Optogenetic cell-type specific activation and silencing with simultaneous electrophysiological recording and; (3) Repeated electrophysiological single and multiple unit recordings during ongoing behavior. The task consists of three components. The subject first makes an observing response by initiating a trial by lever pressing in response to distinctive Go or No-Go tones.  Then, after a variable delay period, the subject is presented with a challenge period cued by white noise during which they must respond with a lever press for the Go condition or withhold from lever pressing for the duration of the cue in the No-Go condition. After correctly responding during the challenge period (Challenge) and a brief delay, a final reward tone of the same frequency as the initiation tone is presented and sucrose reward delivery is available and contingent upon lever pressing. Here, we provide a novel procedure and validating data set that allows researchers to study and manipulate components of behavior such as attention, motivation, impulsivity, and reward-related working memory during an ongoing operant behavioral task while limiting interference from non task-related behaviors.},

@article{HowaEtal14,
	Abstract = {The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is believed to support episodic memory, vivid recollection of a specific event situated in a particular place at a particular time. There is ample neurophysiological evidence that the MTL computes location in allocentric space and more recent evidence that the MTL also codes for time. Space and time represent a similar computational challenge; both are variables that cannot be simply calculated from the immediately available sensory information. We introduce a simple mathematical framework that computes functions of both spatial location and time as special cases of a more general computation. In this framework, experience unfolding in time is encoded via a set of leaky integrators. These leaky integrators encode the Laplace transform of their input. The information contained in the transform can be recovered using an approximation to the inverse Laplace transform. In the temporal domain, the resulting representation reconstructs the temporal history. By integrating movements, the equations give rise to a representation of the path taken to arrive at the present location. By modulating the transform with information about allocentric velocity, the equations code for position of a landmark. Simulated cells show a close correspondence to neurons observed in various regions for all three cases. In the temporal domain, novel secondary analyses of hippocampal time cells verified several qualitative predictions of the model. An integrated representation of spatiotemporal context can be computed by taking conjunctions of these elemental inputs, leading to a correspondence with conjunctive neural representations observed in dorsal CA1.},

	Abstract = {Repeating an item in a list benefits recall performance, and this benefit increases when the repetitions are spaced apart (Madigan, 1969; Melton, 1970). Retrieved context theory incorporates 2 mechanisms that account for these effects: contextual variability and study-phase retrieval. Specifically, if an item presented at position i is repeated at position j, this leads to retrieval of its context from its initial presentation at i (study-phase retrieval), and this retrieved context will be used to update the current state of context (contextual variability). Here we consider predictions of a computational model that embodies retrieved context theory, the context maintenance and retrieval model (CMR; Polyn, Norman, & Kahana, 2009). CMR makes the novel prediction that subjects are more likely to successively recall items that follow a shared repeated item (e.g., i + 1, j + 1) because both items are associated with the context of the repeated item presented at i and j. CMR also predicts that the probability of recalling at least 1 of 2 studied items should increase with the items' spacing (Lohnas, Polyn, & Kahana, 2011). We tested these predictions in a new experiment, and CMR's predictions were upheld. These findings suggest that retrieved context theory offers an integrated explanation for repetition and spacing effects in free recall tasks.

	Abstract = {Considerable recent work has shown that the hippocampus is critical for remembering the order of events in distinct experiences, a defining feature of episodic memory. Correspondingly, hippocampal neuronal activity can 'replay' sequential events in memories and hippocampal neuronal ensembles represent a gradually changing temporal context signal. Most strikingly, single hippocampal neurons - called time cells - encode moments in temporally structured experiences much as the well-known place cells encode locations in spatially structured experiences. These observations bridge largely disconnected literatures on the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory and spatial mapping, and suggest that the fundamental function of the hippocampus is to establish spatio-temporal frameworks for organizing memories.},

	Abstract = {The mammalian hippocampal formation provides neuronal representations of environmental location, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we report a class of cells whose spatially periodic firing patterns are composed of plane waves (or bands) drawn from a discrete set of orientations and wavelengths. The majority of cells recorded in parasubicular and medial entorhinal cortices of freely moving rats belonged to this class and included grid cells, an important subset that corresponds to three bands at 60$\,^{\circ}$ orientations and has the most stable firing pattern. Occasional changes between hexagonal and nonhexagonal patterns imply a common underlying mechanism. Our results indicate a Fourier-like spatial analysis underlying neuronal representations of location, and suggest that path integration is performed by integrating displacement along a restricted set of directions.},

	Abstract = {Short-term memory (STM) refers to the capacity-limited retention of information over a brief period of time, and working memory (WM) refers to the manipulation and use of that information to guide behavior. In recent years it has become apparent that STM and WM interact and overlap with other cognitive processes, including attention (the selection of a subset of information for further processing) and long-term memory (LTM {\~n} the encoding and retention of an effectively unlimited amount of information for a much longer period of time). Broadly speaking, there have been two classes of memory models: systems models, which posit distinct stores for STM and LTM (Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968; Baddeley & Hitch, 1974); and state-based models, which posit a common store with different activation states corresponding to STM and LTM (Cowan, 1995; McElree, 1996; Oberauer, 2002). In this paper, we will focus on state-based accounts of STM. First, we will consider several theoretical models that postulate, based on considerable behavioral evidence, that information in STM can exist in multiple representational states. We will then consider how neural data from recent studies of STM can inform and constrain these theoretical models. In the process we will highlight the inferential advantage of multivariate, information-based analyses of neuroimaging data (fMRI and EEG) over conventional activation-based analysis approaches (Postle, in press). We will conclude by addressing lingering questions regarding the fractionation of STM, highlighting differences between the attention to information vs. the retention of information during brief memory delays.},

	Abstract = {Although it is well established that remembering an item will bring to mind memories of other semantically related items (Bousfield, 1953), the neural basis of this phenomenon is poorly understood. We studied how the similarity relations among items influence their retrieval by analyzing electrocorticographic recordings taken as 46 human neurosurgical patients studied and freely recalled lists of words. We first identified semantic components of neural activity that varied systematically with the meanings of each studied word, as defined by latent semantic analysis (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). We then examined the dynamics of these semantic components as participants attempted to recall the previously studied words. Our analyses revealed that the semantic components of neural activity were spontaneously reactivated during memory search, just before recall of the studied words. Further, the degree to which neural activity correlated with semantic similarity during recall predicted participants' tendencies to organize the sequences of their responses on the basis of semantic similarity. Thus, our work shows that differences in the neural correlates of semantic information, and how they are reactivated before recall, reveal how individuals organize and retrieve memories of words.},

	Abstract = {Theories on the functions of the hippocampal system are based largely on two fundamental discoveries: the amnestic consequences of removing the hippocampus and associated structures in the famous patient H.M. and the observation that spiking activity of hippocampal neurons is associated with the spatial position of the rat. In the footsteps of these discoveries, many attempts were made to reconcile these seemingly disparate functions. Here we propose that mechanisms of memory and planning have evolved from mechanisms of navigation in the physical world and hypothesize that the neuronal algorithms underlying navigation in real and mental space are fundamentally the same. We review experimental data in support of this hypothesis and discuss how specific firing patterns and oscillatory dynamics in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus can support both navigation and memory.},

	Abstract = {Finding our way in spatial environments is an essential part of daily life. How do we come to possess this sense of direction? Extensive research points to the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) as key neural structures underlying spatial navigation. To better understand this system, we examined recordings of single-neuron activity from neurosurgical patients playing a virtual-navigation video game. In addition to place cells, which encode the current virtual location, we describe a unique cell type, EC path cells, the activity of which indicates whether the patient is taking a clockwise or counterclockwise path around the virtual square road. We find that many EC path cells exhibit this directional activity throughout the environment, in contrast to hippocampal neurons, which primarily encode information about specific locations. More broadly, these findings support the hypothesis that EC encodes general properties of the current context (e.g., location or direction) that are used by hippocampus to build unique representations reflecting combinations of these properties.},

	Abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that dorsal hippocampal areas CA3 and CA1 are both involved in representing sequences of events that compose unique episodes. However, it is uncertain whether the contribution of CA3 is restricted to spatial information, and it is unclear whether CA1 encodes order per se or contributes by an active maintenance of memories of sequential events. Here, we developed a new behavioral task that examines memory for the order of sequential nonspatial events presented as trial-unique odor pairings. When the interval between odors within a studied pair was brief (3 sec), bilateral dorsal CA3 lesions severely disrupted memory for their order, whereas dorsal CA1 lesions did not affect performance. However, when the inter-item interval was extended to 10 sec, CA1 lesions, as well as CA3 lesions, severely disrupted performance. These findings suggest that the role of CA3 in sequence memory is not limited to spatial information, but rather appears to be a fundamental property of CA3 function. In contrast, CA1 becomes involved when memories for events must be held or sequenced over long intervals. Thus, CA3 and CA1 are both involved in memory for sequential nonspatial events that compose unique experiences, and these areas play different roles that are distinguished by the duration of time that must be bridged between key events.},

Here we recorded from hippocampal neurons as rats performed a T-maze alternation task in which they were required to remember a preceding experience over a delay in order to make a subsequent spatial choice. As it has been reported previously in other variations of this task, we observed differential firing that predicted correct subsequent choices, even as the animal traversed identical locations prior to the choice. Here we also observed that most place cells also fired differently on correct as compared to error trials. Among these cells, a large majority fired strongly before the delay or during the retrieval phase but were less active or failed to activate when the animal subsequently made an error. These findings join the place cell phenomenon with episodic memory performance dependent on the hippocampus, revealing that memory accuracy can be predicted by the activation of single place cells in the hippocampus.},

No evidence of clustering was found in a sample of >3000 neurons. Moreover, cells active in two environments were uniformly interspersed at a scale of <100 microm, as assessed by the activity-induced gene Arc.

Although the probability of recalling an item varies as a function of where it appeared in the list, the relation between the oscillatory dynamics of successful encoding and serial position remains unexplored. We recorded scalp EEG as participants studied lists of common nouns in a delayed free-recall task. Because early list items were recalled better than items from later serial positions (the primacy effect), we analyzed encoding-related changes in 2 to 100 Hz oscillatory power as a function of serial position. Increases in gamma power in posterior regions predicted successful encoding at early serial positions; widespread low-frequency (4-14 Hz) power decreases predicted successful memory formation for later serial positions. These results suggest that items in early serial positions receive an encoding boost due to focused encoding without having to divide resources among numerous list items. Later in the list, as memory load increases, encoding is divided between multiple items.},

Hippocampal place cells have been proposed to have a role in navigational planning, but direct evidence has been lacking. Here we show that before goal-directed navigation in an open arena, the rat hippocampus generates brief sequences encoding spatial trajectories strongly biased to progress from the subject's current location to a known goal location. These sequences predict immediate future behaviour, even in cases in which the specific combination of start and goal locations is novel. These results indicate that hippocampal sequence events characterized previously in linearly constrained environments as 'replay' are also capable of supporting a goal-directed, trajectory-finding mechanism, which identifies important places and relevant behavioural paths, at specific times when memory retrieval is required, and in a manner that could be used to control subsequent navigational behaviour.},

A nonlinear interaction among pyramidal neurons was observed during sharp wave (SPW)-related population bursts, with stronger synchrony associated with more widespread spatial coherence. SPW bursts emerged in the CA3a-b subregions and spread to CA3c before invading the CA1 area. Synchronous discharge of >10% of the CA3 within a 100 ms window was required to exert a detectable influence on CA1 pyramidal cells. Activity of some CA3 pyramidal neurons differentially predicted the ripple-related discharge of circumscribed groups of CA1 pyramidal cells. We suggest that, in SPW behavioral state, the coherent discharge of a small group of CA3 cells is the primary cause of spiking activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons.},

	Abstract = {The primary aim of this review is to examine evidence for a functional role of gamma and theta oscillations in human episodic memory. It is proposed here that gamma and theta oscillations allow for the transient interaction between cortical structures and the hippocampus for the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories as described by the hippocampal memory indexing theory (Teyler and DiScenna, 1986). Gamma rhythms can act in the cortex to bind perceptual features and in the hippocampus to bind the rich perceptual and contextual information from diverse brain regions into episodic representations. Theta oscillations act to temporally order these individual episodic memory representations. Through feedback projections from the hippocampus to the cortex these gamma and theta patterns could cause the reinstatement of the entire episodic memory representation in the cortex. In addition, theta oscillations could allow for top-down control from the frontal cortex to the hippocampus modulating the encoding and retrieval of episodic memories.},

	Abstract = {Performance of memory tasks is impaired by lesions to either the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or the hippocampus (HPC); although how these two areas contribute to successful performance is not well understood. mPFC unit activity is temporally affected by hippocampal-theta oscillations, with almost half the mPFC population entrained to theta in behaving animals, pointing to theta interactions as the mechanism enabling collaborations between these two areas. mPFC neurons respond to sensory stimuli and responses in working memory tasks, though the function of these correlated firing rate changes remains unclear because similar responses are reported during mPFC dependent and independent tasks. Using a DNMS task we compared error trials vs. correct trials and found almost all mPFC cells fired at similar rates during both error and correct trials (92%), however theta-entrainment of mPFC neurons declined during error performance as only 17% of cells were theta-entrained (during correct trials 46% of the population was theta-entrained). Across the population, error and correct trials did not differ in firing rate, but theta-entrainment was impaired. Periods of theta-entrainment and firing rate changes appeared to be independent variables, and only theta-entrainment was correlated with successful performance, indicating mPFC-HPC theta-range interactions are the key to successful DNMS performance.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus, a structure required for many types of memory, connects to the medial prefrontal cortex, an area that helps direct neuronal information streams during intentional behaviors. Increasing evidence suggests that oscillations regulate communication between these two regions. Theta rhythms may facilitate hippocampal inputs to the medial prefrontal cortex during mnemonic tasks and may also integrate series of functionally relevant gamma-mediated cell assemblies in the medial prefrontal cortex. During slow-wave sleep, temporal coordination of hippocampal sharp wave-ripples and medial prefrontal cortex spindles may be an important component of the process by which memories become hippocampus-independent. Studies using rodent models indicate that oscillatory phase-locking is disturbed in schizophrenia, emphasizing the need for more studies of oscillatory synchrony in the hippocampal-prefrontal network.},

	Abstract = {To study the interplay between hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (Pfc) and its importance for learning and memory consolidation, we measured the coherence in theta oscillations between these two structures in rats learning new rules on a Y maze. Coherence peaked at the choice point, most strongly after task rule acquisition. Simultaneously, Pfc pyramidal neurons reorganized their phase, concentrating at hippocampal theta trough, and synchronous cell assemblies emerged. This synchronous state may result from increased inhibition exerted by interneurons on pyramidal cells, as measured by cross-correlation, and could be modulated by dopamine: we found similar hippocampal-Pfc theta coherence increases and neuronal phase shifts following local administration of dopamine in Pfc of anesthetized rats. Pfc cell assemblies emerging during high coherence were preferentially replayed during subsequent sleep, concurrent with hippocampal sharp waves. Thus, hippocampal/prefrontal coherence could lead to synchronization of reward predicting activity in prefrontal networks, tagging it for subsequent memory consolidation.},

Its miniaturized integration would enable many new applications based on mass-producible, tiny microscopes. Key prospective usages include brain imaging in behaving animals for relating cellular dynamics to animal behavior. Here we introduce a miniature (1.9 g) integrated fluorescence microscope made from mass-producible parts, including a semiconductor light source and sensor. This device enables high-speed cellular imaging across ∼0.5 mm2 areas in active mice. This capability allowed concurrent tracking of Ca2+ spiking in >200 Purkinje neurons across nine cerebellar microzones. During mouse locomotion, individual microzones exhibited large-scale, synchronized Ca2+ spiking. This is a mesoscopic neural dynamic missed by prior techniques for studying the brain at other length scales. Overall, the integrated microscope is a potentially transformative technology that permits distribution to many animals and enables diverse usages, such as portable diagnostics or microscope arrays for large-scale screens.},

	Abstract = {An important category of seemingly maladaptive decisions involves failure to postpone gratification. A person pursuing a desirable long-run outcome may abandon it in favor of a short-run alternative that has been available all along. Here we present a theoretical framework in which this seemingly irrational behavior emerges from stable preferences and veridical judgments. Our account recognizes that decision makers generally face uncertainty regarding the time at which future outcomes will materialize. When timing is uncertain, the value of persistence depends crucially on the nature of a decision maker's prior temporal beliefs. Certain forms of temporal beliefs imply that a delay's predicted remaining length increases as a function of time already waited. In this type of situation, the rational, utility-maximizing strategy is to persist for a limited amount of time and then give up. We show empirically that people's explicit predictions of remaining delay lengths indeed increase as a function of elapsed time in several relevant domains, implying that temporal judgments offer a rational basis for limiting persistence. We then develop our framework into a simple working model and show how it accounts for individual differences in a laboratory task (the well-known "marshmallow test"). We conclude that delay-of-gratification failure, generally viewed as a manifestation of limited self-control capacity, can instead arise as an adaptive response to the perceived statistics of one's environment.},

	Abstract = {The conditional-recency dissociation between immediate and delayed free recall FR; Farrell (Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 36, 324-347, 2010) has critical implications regarding the prolonged debate between unitary and dual-store models of memory. In immediate FR, when the availability of items is controlled for, the recency of the final list item increases across the first few output positions. No such increase is found in delayed FR, with a trend in the opposite direction. This dissociation challenges temporal context TCM; Howard & Kahana (Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 46, 269-299, 2002) and distinctiveness SIMPLE; Brown, Neath, & Chater (Psychological Review, 114, 539-576, 2007) unitary models of memory and suggests the involvement of a short-term buffer in immediate FR. We show that this dissociation is confounded with the different magnitudes of nominal recency (i.e., the prevalence of the final list item) found in immediate as compared to delayed FR. By reshuffling output orders and comparing the empirical results to those of a null hypothesis of no output-order effect, we controlled for the greater prevalence of the final list item that has been observed in immediate FR. Under this control, we found no evidence for a dissociation in the tendency to recall the final list item across output positions. This finding suggests that the conditional-recency dissociation imposes no new constraint on unitary models of memory. More generally, we demonstrate how biases that influence measures of output-order tendencies (e.g., conditional recency) can be controlled for, thus yielding "purer" measures of these variables.},

	Abstract = {Temporal distinctiveness models of recency in free recall predict that increasing the delay between the end of sequence and attempting recall of items from that sequence will reduce recency. An empirical dissociation is reported here that violates this prediction when the delay is introduced by the act of recall itself. Analysis of data from a number of previously published free recall studies shows that when the assumed availability of final list items is taken into account, recency increases across the first few output positions in immediate recall despite the delay introduced by recalling items; no such change, with a trend to decreasing recency, is observed in delayed recall. Simulations are presented, showing that 2 models accounting for recency in free recall, the temporal context model (M. W. Howard & M. J. Kahana, 2002) and the SIMPLE model (G. D. A. Brown, I. Neath, & N. Chater, 2007), are unable to account for this novel pattern of data. Further simulations show that the results are consistent with a short-term buffer contributing to recency in immediate free recall and that ordered probing of items may also contribute to this effect; both of these are consistent with the formulation of a short-term buffer akin to models of serial recall.},

	Abstract = {Although much is known about the dynamics of memory search in the free recall task, relatively little is known about the factors related to recall termination. Reanalyzing individual trial data from 14 prior studies (1,079 participants in 28,015 trials) and defining termination as occurring when a final response is followed by a long nonresponse interval, we observed that termination probability increased throughout the recall period and that retrieval was more likely to terminate following an error than following a correct response. Among errors, termination probability was higher following prior-list intrusions and repetitions than following extralist intrusions. To verify that this pattern of results can be seen in a single study, we report a new experiment in which 80 participants contributed recall data from a total of 9,122 trials. This experiment replicated the pattern observed in the aggregate analysis of the prior studies.},

	Abstract = {A wealth of experimental studies with animals have offered insights about how neural networks within the hippocampus support the temporal organization of memories. These studies have revealed the existence of "time cells" that encode moments in time, much as the well-known "place cells" map locations in space. Another line of work inspired by human behavioral studies suggests that episodic memories are mediated by a state of temporal context that changes gradually over long time scales, up to at least a few thousand seconds. In this view, the "mental time travel" hypothesized to support the experience of episodic memory corresponds to a "jump back in time" in which a previous state of temporal context is recovered. We suggest that these 2 sets of findings could be different facets of a representation of temporal history that maintains a record at the last few thousand seconds of experience. The ability to represent long time scales comes at the cost of discarding precise information about when a stimulus was experienced-this uncertainty becomes greater for events further in the past. We review recent computational work that describes a mechanism that could construct such a scale-invariant representation. Taken as a whole, this suggests the hippocampus plays its role in multiple aspects of cognition by representing events embedded in a general spatiotemporal context. The representation of internal time can be useful across nonhippocampal memory systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).},

	Abstract = {Recollecting past experiences and imagining future experiences activate a common set of brain regions that includes the hippocampus (Schacter, Addis, & Buckner, 2007), and both functions are impaired in people with compromised hippocampal function (Klein, Loftus, & Kihlstrom, 2002; Tulving, 1985). These findings indicate a role for the hippocampus that extends beyond declarative memory. However, a case study revealed that a person with extensive medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage and episodic amnesia was able to forgo smaller, immediate rewards for a larger future payoff to a degree similar to control participants (Kwan et al., 2012). This finding suggests that typical regard for the future does not depend on hippocampal integrity. To test this hypothesis, the current study examined the nature and limits of the role of the hippocampus in future thinking and decision making in amnesic individuals with hippocampal damage and associated impairments in episodic memory and future imagining. The amnesic individuals were administered a delay discounting task to assess valuation of future rewards, a probability discounting task to assess risk taking, and the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory to assess personal orientation toward the past, present, and future. Comparisons with demographically matched controls indicated that aspects of temporal thought and future-oriented decision making are preserved in individuals with hippocampal amnesia despite their inability to imagine themselves in detailed future events. Thus, even extensive MTL damage and the resulting episodic amnesia do not preclude prudent decision making, including consideration of future financial outcomes and personal identification with the past and future.

	Abstract = {The complementary learning systems theory of the roles of hippocampus and neocortex (McClelland, McNaughton, & O'Reilly, 1995) holds that the rapid integration of arbitrary new information into neocortical structures is avoided to prevent catastrophic interference with structured knowledge representations stored in synaptic connections among neocortical neurons. Recent studies (Tse et al., 2007, 2011) showed that neocortical circuits can rapidly acquire new associations that are consistent with prior knowledge. The findings challenge the complementary learning systems theory as previously presented. However, new simulations extending those reported in McClelland et al. (1995) show that new information that is consistent with knowledge previously acquired by a putatively cortexlike artificial neural network can be learned rapidly and without interfering with existing knowledge; it is when inconsistent new knowledge is acquired quickly that catastrophic interference ensues. Several important features of the findings of Tse et al. (2007, 2011) are captured in these simulations, indicating that the neural network model used in McClelland et al. has characteristics in common with neocortical learning mechanisms. An additional simulation generalizes beyond the network model previously used, showing how the rate of change of cortical connections can depend on prior knowledge in an arguably more biologically plausible network architecture. In sum, the findings of Tse et al. are fully consistent with the idea that hippocampus and neocortex are complementary learning systems. Taken together, these findings and the simulations reported here advance our knowledge by bringing out the role of consistency of new experience with existing knowledge and demonstrating that the rate of change of connections in real and artificial neural networks can be strongly prior-knowledge dependent.

	Abstract = {Episodic memory allows people to reexperience the past by recovering the sequences of events that characterize those prior experiences. Although experience is continuous, people are able to selectively retrieve and reexperience more discrete episodes from their past, raising the possibility that some elements become tightly related to each other in memory, whereas others do not. The current series of experiments was designed to ask how shifts in context during an experience influence how people remember the past. Specifically, we asked how context shifts influence the ability to remember the relative order of past events, a hallmark of episodic memory. We found that memory for the order of events was enhanced within, rather than across, context shifts, or boundaries (Experiment 1). Next, we showed that this relative enhancement in order memory was eliminated when across-item associative processing was disrupted (Experiment 2), suggesting that context shifts have a selective effect on sequential binding. Finally, we provide evidence that the act of making order memory judgments involves the reactivation of representations that bridged the tested items (Experiment 3). Together, these data suggest that boundaries may serve to parse continuous experience into sequences of contextually related events and that this organization facilitates remembering the temporal order of events that share the same context.

	Abstract = {A key function of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is to generate predictions based on prior experience (Bar, 2009). We propose that these MTL-generated predictions guide learning, such that predictions from memory influence memory itself. Considering this proposal within a context-based theory of learning and memory leads to the unique hypothesis that the act of predicting an event from the current context can enhance later memory for that event, even if the event does not actually occur. We tested this hypothesis using a novel paradigm in which the contexts of some stimuli were repeated during an incidental learning task, without the stimuli themselves being repeated. Results from 4 experiments show clear behavioral evidence in support of this hypothesis: Participants were more likely to remember once-presented items if the temporal contexts of those items were later repeated. However, this effect only occurred in learning environments where predictions could be helpful. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved).},

It has long been thought that microsaccades enable exploration of small regions in the scene in the same way saccades are normally used to scan larger regions. This hypothesis, however, has remained controversial, as it is believed that microsaccades are suppressed during fine spatial judgments. We examined the eye movements of human observers in a high-acuity visuomotor task, the threading of a needle in a computer-simulated virtual environment. Using a method for gaze-contingent display that enables accurate localization of the line of sight, we found that microsaccades precisely move the eye to nearby regions of interest and are dynamically modulated by the ongoing demands of the task. These results indicate that microsaccades are part of the oculomotor strategy by which the visual system acquires fine spatial detail.},

	Abstract = {Humans and other species continually perform microscopic eye movements, even when attending to a single point. These movements, which include drifts and microsaccades, are under oculomotor control, elicit strong neural responses, and have been thought to serve important functions. The influence of these fixational eye movements on the acquisition and neural processing of visual information remains unclear. Here, we show that during viewing of natural scenes, microscopic eye movements carry out a crucial information-processing step: they remove predictable correlations in natural scenes by equalizing the spatial power of the retinal image within the frequency range of ganglion cells' peak sensitivity. This transformation, which had been attributed to center-surround receptive field organization, occurs prior to any neural processing and reveals a form of matching between the statistics of natural images and those of normal eye movements. We further show that the combined effect of microscopic eye movements and retinal receptive field organization is to convert spatial luminance discontinuities into synchronous firing events, beginning the process of edge detection. Thus, microscopic eye movements are fundamental to two goals of early visual processing: redundancy reduction and feature extraction.},

	Abstract = {We are normally not aware of the microscopic eye movements that keep the retinal image in motion during visual fixation. In principle, perceptual cancellation of the displacements of the retinal stimulus caused by fixational eye movements could be achieved either by means of motor/proprioceptive information or by inferring eye movements directly from the retinal stimulus. In this study, we examined the mechanisms underlying visual stability during ocular drift, the primary source of retinal image motion during fixation on a stationary scene. By using an accurate system for gaze-contingent display control, we decoupled the eye movements of human observers from the changes in visual input that they normally cause. We show that the visual system relies on the spatiotemporal stimulus on the retina, rather than on extraretinal information, to discard the motion signals resulting from ocular drift. These results have important implications for the establishment of stable visual representations in the brain and argue that failure to visually determine eye drift contributes to well known motion illusions such as autokinesis and induced movement.},

	Abstract = {Our eyes are constantly in motion. Even during visual fixation, small eye movements continually jitter the location of gaze. It is known that visual percepts tend to fade when retinal image motion is eliminated in the laboratory. However, it has long been debated whether, during natural viewing, fixational eye movements have functions in addition to preventing the visual scene from fading. In this study, we analysed the influence in humans of fixational eye movements on the discrimination of gratings masked by noise that has a power spectrum similar to that of natural images. Using a new method of retinal image stabilization, we selectively eliminated the motion of the retinal image that normally occurs during the intersaccadic intervals of visual fixation. Here we show that fixational eye movements improve discrimination of high spatial frequency stimuli, but not of low spatial frequency stimuli. This improvement originates from the temporal modulations introduced by fixational eye movements in the visual input to the retina, which emphasize the high spatial frequency harmonics of the stimulus. In a natural visual world dominated by low spatial frequencies, fixational eye movements appear to constitute an effective sampling strategy by which the visual system enhances the processing of spatial detail.},

	Abstract = {One of the most intriguing aspects of adaptive behavior involves the inference of regularities and rules in ever-changing environments. Rules are often deduced through evidence-based learning which relies on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This is a highly dynamic process, evolving trial by trial and therefore may not be adequately captured by averaging single-unit responses over numerous repetitions. Here, we employed advanced statistical techniques to visualize the trajectories of ensembles of simultaneously recorded medial PFC neurons on a trial-by-trial basis as rats deduced a novel rule in a set-shifting task. Neural populations formed clearly distinct and lasting representations of familiar and novel rules by entering unique network states. During rule acquisition, the recorded ensembles often exhibited abrupt transitions, rather than evolving continuously, in tight temporal relation to behavioral performance shifts. These results support the idea that rule learning is an evidence-based decision process, perhaps accompanied by moments of sudden insight.},

In humans, if and how visual cortices perform temporal processing remains unclear. Here we show that both primary visual cortex (V1) and extrastriate area V5/MT are causally involved in encoding and keeping time in memory and that this involvement is independent from low-level visual processing. Most importantly we demonstrate that V1 and V5/MT come into play simultaneously and seem to be functionally linked during interval encoding, whereas they operate serially (V1 followed by V5/MT) and seem to be independent while maintaining temporal information in working memory. These data help to refine our knowledge of the functional properties of human visual cortex, highlighting the contribution and the temporal dynamics of V1 and V5/MT in the processing of the temporal aspects of visual information.},

	Abstract = {Time interval estimation is involved in numerous behavioral processes, but its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In particular, it has been controversial whether time is encoded on a linear or logarithmic scale. Based on our previous finding that inactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) profoundly impairs rat's ability to discriminate time intervals, we investigated how the mPFC processes temporal information by examining activity of mPFC neurons in rats performing a temporal bisection task. Many mPFC neurons conveyed temporal information based on monotonically changing activity profiles over time with negative accelerations, so that their activity profiles were better described by logarithmic than linear functions. Moreover, the precision of time-interval discrimination based on neural activity was lowered in proportion to the elapse of time, but without proportional increase in neural variability, which is well accounted for by logarithmic, but not by linear functions. As a population, mPFC neurons conveyed precise information about the elapse of time with their activity tightly correlated with the animal's choice of target. These results suggest that the mPFC might be part of an internal clock in charge of controlling interval-timing behavior, and that linearly changing neuronal activity on a logarithmic time scale might be one way of representing the elapse of time in the brain.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have reported the existence of hippocampal "time cells," neurons that fire at particular moments during periods when behavior and location are relatively constant. However, an alternative explanation of apparent time coding is that hippocampal neurons "path integrate" to encode the distance an animal has traveled. Here, we examined hippocampal neuronal firing patterns as rats ran in place on a treadmill, thus "clamping" behavior and location, while we varied the treadmill speed to distinguish time elapsed from distance traveled. Hippocampal neurons were strongly influenced by time and distance, and less so by minor variations in location. Furthermore, the activity of different neurons reflected integration over time and distance to varying extents, with most neurons strongly influenced by both factors and some significantly influenced by only time or distance. Thus, hippocampal neuronal networks captured both the organization of time and distance in a situation where these dimensions dominated an ongoing experience.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampal formation in both rats and humans is involved in spatial navigation. In the rat, cells coding for places, directions, and speed of movement have been recorded from the hippocampus proper and/or the neighbouring subicular complex. Place fields of a group of the hippocampal pyramidal cells cover the surface of an environment but do not appear to do so in any systematic fashion. That is, there is no topographical relation between the anatomical location of the cells within the hippocampus and the place fields of these cells in an environment. Recent work shows that place cells are responding to the summation of two or more Gaussian curves, each of which is fixed at a given distance to two or more walls in the environment. The walls themselves are probably identified by their allocentric direction relative to the rat and this information may be provided by the head direction cells. The right human hippocampus retains its role in spatial mapping as demonstrated by its activation during accurate navigation in imagined and virtual reality environments. In addition, it may have taken on wider memory functions, perhaps by the incorporation of a linear time tag which allows for the storage of the times of visits to particular locations. This extended system would serve as the basis for a spatio-temporal event or episodic memory system.},

	Abstract = {Local inhibitory microcircuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and their role in network activity are little investigated. Using a combination of electrophysiological, optical, and morphological circuit analysis tools, we find that layer II stellate cells are embedded in a dense local inhibitory microcircuit. Specifically, we report a gradient of inhibitory inputs along the dorsoventral axis of the MEC, with the majority of this local inhibition arising from parvalbumin positive (PV+) interneurons. Finally, the gradient of PV+ fibers is accompanied by a gradient in the power of extracellular network oscillations in the gamma range, measured both in vitro and in vivo. The reported differences in the inhibitory microcircuitry in layer II of the MEC may therefore have a profound functional impact on the computational working principles at different locations of the entorhinal network and influence the input pathways to the hippocampus.},

It has long been suggested that the hippocampal CA3 region is able to support short-term information retention through persistent neural firing. Theoretical studies have shown that this persistent firing can be supported by abundant excitatory recurrent connections in CA3. However, it remains unclear whether individual cells can support persistent firing. In this study, using in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in a rat hippocampal slice preparation, we show that hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells support persistent firing under perfusion of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (10 μm). Furthermore, in contrast to earlier theoretical studies, this persistent firing is independent of ionotropic glutamatergic synaptic transmission and is supported by the calcium-activated non-selective cationic current. Because cholinergic receptor activation is crucial for short-term memory tasks, persistent firing in individual cells may support short-term information retention in the hippocampal CA3 region.},

	Abstract = {Medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas are crucial for memory tasks such as spatial working memory and temporal association memory, which require an active maintenance of memory for a short period of time (a few hundred milliseconds to tens of seconds). Recent work has shown that the projection from layer III neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to hippocampal region CA1, the temporoammonic (TA) pathway, might be specially important for these memory tasks. In addition, lesions to the entorhinal cortex disrupt persistent firing in CA1 which is believed to support active maintenance of memory. Injection of cholinergic antagonists and group I mGlu receptor antagonists to the MEC impairs spatial working memory and temporal association memory. Consistent with this, we have shown that group I mGlu receptor activation supports persistent firing in principal cells of the MEC layer III in vitro (Yoshida et al. [39]). However, it still remains unknown whether cholinergic receptor activation also supports persistent firing in MEC layer III neurons. In this paper, we tested this in MEC layer III cells using both ruptured and perforated whole-cell recordings in vitro. We report that the majority of cells we recorded from in MEC layer III show persistent firing during perfusion of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (2-10μM). In addition, repeated stimulation gradually suppressed persistent firing. We further discuss the possible role of persistent firing in memory function in general.},

	Abstract = {1. Several studies of auditory cortex have examined the competitive inhibition that can occur when appropriate sounds are presented to each ear. However, most cortical neurons also show both excitation and inhibition in response to presentation of stimuli at one ear alone. The extent of such inhibition has not been described. Forward masking, in which a variable masking stimulus was followed by a fixed probe stimulus (within the excitatory response area), was used to examine the extent of monaural inhibition for neurons in primary auditory cortex of anesthetized cats (barbiturate or barbiturate-ketamine). Both the masking and probe stimuli were 50-ms tone pips presented to the contralateral ear. Most cortical neurons showed significant forward masking at delays beyond which masking effects in the auditory nerve are relatively small compared with those seen in cortical neurons. Analysis was primarily concerned with such components. Standard rate-level functions were also obtained and were examined for nonmonotonicity, an indication of level-dependent monaural inhibition. 2. Consistent with previous reports, a wide range of frequency tuning properties (excitatory response area shapes) was found in cortical neurons. This was matched by a wide range of forward-masking-derived inhibitory response areas. At the most basic level of analysis, these were classified according to the presence of lateral inhibition, i.e., where a probe tone at a neuron's characteristic frequency was masked by tones outside the limits of the excitatory response area. Lateral inhibition was a property of 38% of the sampled neurons. Such neurons represented 77% of those with nonmonotonic rate-level functions, indicating a strong correlation between the two indexes of monaural inhibition; however, the shapes of forward masking inhibitory response areas did not usually correspond with those required to account for the "tuning" of a neuron. In addition, it was found that level-dependent inhibition was not added to by forward masking inhibition. 3. Analysis of the discharges to individual stimulus pair presentations, under conditions of partial masking, revealed that discharges to the probe occurred independently of discharges to the preceding masker. This indicates that even when the masker is within a neuron's excitatory response area, forward masking is not a postdischarge habituation phenomenon. However, for most neurons the degree of masking summed over multiple stimulus presentations appears determined by the same stimulus parameters that determine the probability of response to the masker.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Repetitive acoustic stimulation, auditory fear conditioning, and focal electric stimulation of the auditory cortex (AC) each evoke the reorganization of the central auditory system. Our current study of the big brown bat indicates that focal electric stimulation of the AC evokes center-surround reorganization of the frequency map of the AC. In the center, the neuron's best frequencies (BFs), together with their frequency-tuning curves, shift toward the BFs of electrically stimulated cortical neurons (centripetal BF shifts). In the surround, BFs shift away from the stimulated cortical BF (centrifugal BF shifts). Centripetal BF shifts are much larger than centrifugal BF shifts. An antagonist (bicuculline methiodide) of inhibitory synaptic transmitter receptors changes centrifugal BF shifts into centripetal BF shifts, whereas its agonist (muscimol) changes centripetal BF shifts into centrifugal BF shifts. This reorganization of the AC thus depends on a balance between facilitation and inhibition evoked by focal cortical electric stimulation. Unlike neurons in the AC of the big brown bat, neurons in the Doppler-shifted constant-frequency (DSCF) area of the AC of the mustached bat are highly specialized for fine-frequency analysis and show almost exclusively centrifugal BF shifts for focal electric stimulation of the DSCF area. Our current data indicate that in the highly specialized area, lateral inhibition is strong compared with the less-specialized area and that the specialized and nonspecialized areas both share the same inhibitory mechanism for centrifugal BF shifts.},

Here we provide evidence that neural representations reflecting the specificity or generality of memories are differentially represented along the dorsoventral axis of the CA3 area of the rat hippocampus. In dorsal CA3, neurons rapidly associate the identity of events with specific locations whereas, in more ventrally located CA3 regions, neurons gradually accumulate information across extended training to form representations that generalize across related events within a spatial context and distinguish events across contexts.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is thought to represent nonspatial information in the context of spatial information. An animal can derive both spatial information as well as nonspatial information from the objects (landmarks) it encounters as it moves around in an environment. In this article, correlates of both object-derived spatial as well as nonspatial information in the hippocampus of rats foraging in the presence of objects are demonstrated. A new form of CA1 place cells, called landmark-vector cells, that encode spatial locations as a vector relationship to local landmarks is described. Such landmark vector relationships can be dynamically encoded. Of the 26 CA1 neurons that developed new fields in the course of a day's recording sessions, in eight cases, the new fields were located at a similar distance and direction from a landmark as the initial field was located relative to a different landmark. In addition, object-location memory in the hippocampus is also described. When objects were removed from an environment or moved to new locations, a small number of neurons in CA1 and CA3 increased firing at the locations where the objects used to be. In some neurons, this increase occurred only in one location, indicating object + place conjunctive memory; in other neurons, the increase in firing was seen at multiple locations where an object used to be. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the spatially restricted firing of hippocampal neurons encode multiple types of information regarding the relationship between an animal's location and the location of objects in its environment. {\copyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Single-neuron activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is tuned to mixtures of multiple task-related aspects. Such mixed selectivity is highly heterogeneous, seemingly disordered and therefore difficult to interpret. We analysed the neural activity recorded in monkeys during an object sequence memory task to identify a role of mixed selectivity in subserving the cognitive functions ascribed to the PFC. We show that mixed selectivity neurons encode distributed information about all task-relevant aspects. Each aspect can be decoded from the population of neurons even when single-cell selectivity to that aspect is eliminated. Moreover, mixed selectivity offers a significant computational advantage over specialized responses in terms of the repertoire of input-output functions implementable by readout neurons. This advantage originates from the highly diverse nonlinear selectivity to mixtures of task-relevant variables, a signature of high-dimensional neural representations. Crucially, this dimensionality is predictive of animal behaviour as it collapses in error trials. Our findings recommend a shift of focus for future studies from neurons that have easily interpretable response tuning to the widely observed, but rarely analysed, mixed selectivity neurons.},

	Abstract = {There is an intensive debate on whether memory for serial order is symmetric. The objective of this study was to explore whether associative asymmetry is modulated by memory task (recognition vs. cued recall). Participants were asked to memorize word triples (Experiments 1-2) or pairs (Experiments 3-6) during the study phase. They then recalled the word by a cue during a cued recall task (Experiments 1-4) and judged whether the presented 2 words were in the same or in a different order compared with the study phase during a recognition task (Experiments 1-6). To control for perceptual matching between the study and test phase, participants were presented with vertical test pairs when they made directional judgment in Experiment 5. In Experiment 6, participants also made associative recognition judgments for word pairs presented at the same or the reversed position. The results showed that forward associations were recalled at similar levels as backward associations and that the correlations between forward and backward associations were high in the cued recall tasks. On the other hand, the direction of forward associations was recognized more accurately (and more quickly) than backward associations, and their correlations were comparable to the control condition in the recognition tasks. This forward advantage was also obtained for the associative recognition task. Diminishing positional information did not change the pattern of associative asymmetry. These results suggest that associative asymmetry is modulated by cued recall and recognition manipulations and that direction as a constituent part of a memory trace can facilitate associative memory.},

	Abstract = {The present studies used response time (RT) and accuracy to explore the processes and relation of recognition and cued recall. The studies used free-response and signal-to-respond techniques and varied list length and presentation rate. In Experiment 1, the free-RT distributions for recognition had much lower mean and variance than those for cued recall. Similarly, signal-to-respond curves showed fast rates of accumulation of information in recognition and slow rates in recall. (Quantitative models of the results are presented in the companion article by D. E. Diller, P. A. Nobel, and R. M. Shiffrin, 2001). To rule out the possibility that the slower responses in cued recall were due to a fast retrieval process followed by a slow process of cleaning up the retrieved trace for output, additional signal-to-respond tasks provided the relevant alternatives at test. Yet, these conditions showed slow growth rates, similar to those seen in recall. The results support the hypothesis that retrieval processes differ for single-item recognition and cued recall, with retrieval in cued recall (and associative recognition) due to a sequential search.},

	Abstract = {This article presents a model for accuracy and response time (RT) in recognition and cued recall, fitted to free-response and signal-to-respond data from Experiment 1 of P. A. Nobel and R. M. Shiffrin (2001). The model posits that recognition operates through parallel activation in a single retrieval step and cued recall operates as a sequential search. Because the data for recognition showed that variations in list length and study time per list had a large effect on accuracy but a small or negligible effect on (a) free-response RT distributions and (b) retrieval dynamics in signal-to-respond, the timing of the recognition decision is based on an assessment of retrieval completion (ARC), rather than on a sufficiency of evidence in favor of 1 of the response options. By assuming within-trial forgetting, the model predicts both the dissociation of accuracy and RT and the finding that errors are slower than correct responses. For cued recall, this model was incorporated as the 1st step in a search consisting of cycles of sampling and recovery.},

It is crucial for decisions about quantity, speed of movement and rate of return, as well as for motor control in walking, speech, playing or appreciating music, and participating in sports. Traditionally, the way in which time is perceived, represented and estimated has been explained using a pacemaker-accumulator model that is not only straightforward, but also surprisingly powerful in explaining behavioural and biological data. However, recent advances have challenged this traditional view. It is now proposed that the brain represents time in a distributed manner and tells the time by detecting the coincidental activation of different neural populations.},

	Abstract = {Prior knowledge, in the form of a mental schema or framework, is viewed to facilitate the learning of new information in a range of experimental and everyday scenarios. Despite rising interest in the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying schema-driven facilitation of new learning, few paradigms have been developed to examine this issue in humans. Here we develop a multiphase experimental scenario aimed at characterizing schema-based effects in the context of a paradigm that has been very widely used across species, the transitive inference task. We show that an associative schema, comprised of prior knowledge of the rank positions of familiar items in the hierarchy, has a marked effect on transitivity performance and the development of relational knowledge of the hierarchy that cannot be accounted for by more general changes in task strategy. Further, we show that participants are capable of deploying prior knowledge to successful effect under surprising conditions (i.e., when corrective feedback is totally absent), but only when the associative schema is robust. Finally, our results provide insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying such schema-driven effects, and suggest that new hierarchy learning in the transitive inference task can occur through a contextual transfer mechanism that exploits the structure of associative experiences.},

We found that temporal and spatial enumeration processes engaged different populations of neurons in the intraparietal sulcus of behaving monkeys. Once the enumeration process was completed, however, another neuronal population represented the cardinality of a set irrespective of whether it had been cued in a spatial layout or across time. These data suggest distinct neural processing stages for different numerical formats, but also a final convergence of the segregated information to form most abstract quantity representations.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical analysis shows that if the pattern of rehearsal in free-recall experiments (of necessity, the pattern observed when participants rehearse aloud) be continued without any further interruption by stimuli (as happens during recall), it terminates with the retrieval of the same 1 word over and over again. Such a terminal state is commonly reached before some of the words in the list have been retrieved even once; those words are not recalled. The 1 minute frequently allowed for recall in free-recall experiments is ample time for retrieval to seize up in this way. The author proposes a model that represents the essential features of the pattern of rehearsal; validates that model by reference to the overt rehearsal data from B. B. Murdock, Jr., and J. Metcalfe (1978) and the recall data from B. B. Murdock, Jr., and R. Okada (1970); demonstrates the long-term properties of continued sequences of retrievals and, also, a fundamental relation linking recall to the total time of presentation; and, finally, compares failure to recall in free-recall experiments with forgetting in general.},

	Abstract = {The scenario for free recall set out in Laming (2009) is developed to provide models for the serial position curves from 5 selected sets of data, for final free recall, and for multitrial free recall. The 5 sets of data reflect the effects of rate of presentation, length of list, delay of recall, and suppression of rehearsal. Each model accommodates the serial position curve for first recalls (where those data are available) as well as that for total recalls. Both curves are fit with the same parameter values, as also (with 1 exception) are all of the conditions compared within each experiment. The distributions of numbers of recalls are also examined and shown to have variances increased above what would be expected if successive recalls were independent. This is taken to signify that, in those experiments in which rehearsals were not recorded, the retrieval of words for possible recall follows the same pattern that is observed following overt rehearsal, namely, that retrieval consists of runs of consecutive elements from memory. Finally, 2 sets of data are examined that the present approach cannot accommodate. It is argued that the problem with these data derives from an interaction between the patterns of (covert) rehearsal and the parameters of list presentation.},

	Abstract = {Cortical neurons receive synaptic inputs from thousands of afferents that fire action potentials at rates ranging from less than 1 hertz to more than 200 hertz. Both the number of afferents and their large dynamic range can mask changes in the spatial and temporal pattern of synaptic activity, limiting the ability of a cortical neuron to respond to its inputs. Modeling work based on experimental measurements indicates that short-term depression of intracortical synapses provides a dynamic gain-control mechanism that allows equal percentage rate changes on rapidly and slowly firing afferents to produce equal postsynaptic responses. Unlike inhibitory and adaptive mechanisms that reduce responsiveness to all inputs, synaptic depression is input-specific, leading to a dramatic increase in the sensitivity of a neuron to subtle changes in the firing patterns of its afferents.},

	Abstract = {Perception and motor control are often regarded as two separate branches of neuroscience. Like most species, however, humans are not passively exposed to the incoming flow of sensory data, but actively seek useful information. By shaping input signals in ways that simplify perceptual tasks, behavior might play an important role in establishing efficient sensory representations in the brain. Under natural viewing conditions, the main source of motion of the stimulus on the retina is not the scene but our own behavior. The retinal image is never still, even during visual fixation, when small eye movements combine with movements of the head and body to continually perturb the location of gaze. This article examines the impact of the fixational motion of the retinal image on the statistics of visual input and the neural encoding of visual information. Building upon recent theoretical and experimental results, it is argued that an unstable fixation constitutes an efficient strategy for acquiring information from natural scenes. According to this theory, the fluctuations of luminance caused by the incessant motion of the eye equalize the power present at different spatial frequencies in the spatiotemporal stimulus on the retina. This phenomenon yields compact neural representations, emphasizes fine spatial detail, and might enable a temporal multiplexing of visual information from the retina to the cortex. This theory posits motor contributions to early visual representations and suggests that perception and behavior are more intimately tied than commonly thought.},

	Abstract = {What causes new information to be mistakenly attributed to an old experience? Some theories predict that reinstating the context of a prior experience allows new information to be bound to that context, leading to source memory confusion. To examine this prediction, we had human participants study two lists of items (visual objects) on separate days while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. List 1 items were accompanied by a stream of scene images during the intertrial interval, but list 2 items were not. As in prior work by Hupbach et al. (2009), we observed an asymmetric pattern of misattributions on a subsequent source memory test: participants showed a strong tendency to misattribute list 2 items to list 1 but not vice versa. We hypothesized that these memory errors were due to participants reinstating the list 1 context during list 2. To test this hypothesis, we used a pattern classifier to measure scene-related neural activity during list 2 study. Because scenes were visually present during list 1 but not list 2, scene-related activity during list 2 study can be used as a time-varying neural indicator of how much participants were reinstating the list 1 context during list 2 study. In keeping with our hypothesis, we found that prestimulus scene activation during the study of list 2 items was significantly higher for items subsequently misattributed to list 1 than for items subsequently correctly attributed to list 2. We conclude by discussing how these findings relate to theories of memory reconsolidation.},

	Abstract = {Summed-similarity models of visual episodic recognition memory successfully predict the variation in false alarm rates across different test items. With data averaged across subjects, Kahana and Sekuler demonstrated that subjects' performance appears to change along with the mean similarity among study items; with high interstimulus similarity, subjects were less likely to commit false alarms to similar lures. We examined this effect in detail by systematically varying the coordinates of study and test items along a critical stimulus dimension and measuring memory performance at each point. To reduce uncontrolled variance associated with individual differences in vision, the coordinates of study and test items were scaled according to each subject's discrimination threshold. Fitting each of four summed-similarity models to the individual subjects' data demonstrated a clear superiority for models that take account of interitem similarity on a trialwise basis.},

	Abstract = {Primates are very good at recognizing objects independent of viewing angle or retinal position, and they outperform existing computer vision systems by far. But invariant object recognition is only one prerequisite for successful interaction with the environment. An animal also needs to assess an object's position and relative rotational angle. We propose here a model that is able to extract object identity, position, and rotation angles. We demonstrate the model behavior on complex three-dimensional objects under translation and rotation in depth on a homogeneous background. A similar model has previously been shown to extract hippocampal spatial codes from quasi-natural videos. The framework for mathematical analysis of this earlier application carries over to the scenario of invariant object recognition. Thus, the simulation results can be explained analytically even for the complex high-dimensional data we employed.},

	Abstract = {Invariant features of temporally varying signals are useful for analysis and classification. Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decorrelated features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously.},

	Abstract = {A novel architecture and set of learning rules for cortical self-organization is proposed. The model is based on the idea that multiple information channels can modulate one another's plasticity. Features learned from bottom-up information sources can thus be influenced by those learned from contextual pathways, and vice versa. A maximum likelihood cost function allows this scheme to be implemented in a biologically feasible, hierarchical neural circuit. In simulations of the model, we first demonstrate the utility of temporal context in modulating plasticity. The model learns a representation that categorizes people's faces according to identity, independent of viewpoint, by taking advantage of the temporal continuity in image sequences. In a second set of simulations, we add plasticity to the contextual stream and explore variations in the architecture. In this case, the model learns a two-tiered representation, starting with a coarse view-based clustering and proceeding to a finer clustering of more specific stimulus features. This model provides a tenable account of how people may perform 3D object recognition in a hierarchical, bottom-up fashion.},

Research on event perception has focused on transient elevations in predictive uncertainty or surprise as the primary signal driving event segmentation. We present human behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) evidence in favor of a different account, in which event representations coalesce around clusters or 'communities' of mutually predicting stimuli. Through parsing behavior, fMRI adaptation and multivoxel pattern analysis, we demonstrate the emergence of event representations in a domain containing such community structure, but in which transition probabilities (the basis of uncertainty and surprise) are uniform. We present a computational account of how the relevant representations might arise, proposing a direct connection between event learning and the learning of semantic categories.},

Knowledge is formed through the accrual of individual events, a process that operates in tandem with the storage of individual event memories. In 2 studies, new knowledge about Chinese characters is trained over several weeks, different characters receiving differential training, followed by tests of episodic recognition memory, pseudo-lexical decision, and forced-choice perceptual identification. The large effects of training frequency in both studies demonstrated an important role of pure frequency in addition to differential context and differential similarity. The SARKAE theory provides a framework within which models for various tasks can be developed; we illustrate the way this could operate, and we make the verbal descriptions of the theory more precise with a simplified simulation model applied to the results.},

Short RSD groups produced lower hit rates but higher conjunction error rates compared to long RSD groups. Repetition effects on conjunction errors occurred for short RSD but not long RSD groups. In Experiment 3, additional judgements on new items were solicited to show that the "null" effects for long RSD groups in the earlier experiments were, in fact, illusory.

In Experiment 2 the conjunction error rate increased significantly from a 0- to a 1-word lag, then decreased slightly from a 1- to a 5-word lag. The results provide mixed support for simple familiarity and dual-process accounts of recognition. Paradoxically, searching for an item in memory does not appear to be a good encoding task.},

	Abstract = {A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE FOR SYSTEMS NEUROSCIENCE IS TO QUANTITATIVELY RELATE ITS THREE MAJOR BRANCHES OF RESEARCH: brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need to define the correspondency between the units of the model and the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology), and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis, we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.},

The latter finding is known as output interference, and the results of the experiment reported here indicate that a release from output interference is obtained when the nature of the items is changed during testing. Specifically, when participants are asked to recognize items from two categories, output interference is minimized when items from each category are tested separately in large blocks. This finding supports models of forgetting that assume interference arises from information about the to-be-learned material that is stored in memory; in contrast, this finding is difficult to explain using models that assume forgetting is the result only of changing context.},

The results of 5 experiments reported here suggest that a strength-based mirror effect is caused by a shift in the location of the decision criterion, whereas a frequency-based mirror effect occurs although the criterion remains fixed with respect to word frequency. Evidence supporting these claims is provided by a series of studies in which high frequency (HF) words were differentially strengthened (and sometimes differentially colored) during list presentation. That manipulation increased the HF hit rate above that for low frequency (LF) words without selectively decreasing the HF false alarm rate, just as a fixed-criterion account of the word-frequency mirror effect predicts.},

Steyvers, 1997), an episodic model of memory, is extended to implicit memory phenomena, namely the perceptual identification studies reported in R. Ratcliff and G. McKoon (1997). In those studies, the influence of prior study was greatest when words were presented most briefly and when forced-choice targets and foils were most similar. R. Ratcliff and G. McKoon use these data to argue against models in which prior study changes a word's representation. A model in which prior study changes a word's representation by adding context information is fit to their data; at test, the model uses a Bayesian decision process to compare the perceptual and context features associated with the test flash to stored traces. The effects of prior study are due to matching extra context information and are larger when alternatives share many features, thereby reducing noise that attenuates these effects.},

Models agree that the subjective strength of targets increases with additional time for encoding however the origin of the subjective strength of foils remains disputed. Under the fixed strength assumption the distribution of memory strength for foils is invariant across experimental manipulations of encoding. For example, the subjective strength of foils may depend solely on the pre-experimental history of the item, thus encoding manipulations have no impact. In contrast, under the differentiation assumption the subjective strength of foils depends on the nature of the traces stored in episodic memory. If those traces are well encoded, the subjective strength of foils will be lower than the case where noisy traces are stored (e.g., when targets received minimal encoding). The fixed strength and differentiation accounts are tested by measuring direct ratings of memory strength. In Experiments 1 and 2, item strength is varied via repetition and in Experiment 3 response bias is varied via the relative proportion of targets on the test list. For all experiments empirical distributions of memory strength were obtained and compared to the distributions predicted by the two accounts. The differentiation assumption provides the most parsimonious account of the data.},

Many current models predict that pairs and singles of all types will jointly interfere and therefore harm memory. Such list length effects have often been observed for lists of a single-item type (e.g., a list of words). Here, we examine interference for lists containing multiple types of pairs (e.g., word-word, face-face, word-face). In three experiments, we manipulate the number of each type on the study list. In associative recognition, discrimination fell as the number of pairs of the same type rose, but the number of pairs of other types had little effect. That is, we found a list length effect within, but not between, classes of stimuli. We highlight the importance of representation and propose alternatives to current model representations that can predict such findings.},

Subjective memory strength should increase for targets and simultaneously decrease for foils following a strongly encoded list compared with a weakly encoded list. An alternative explanation for the strength-based mirror effect is that participants adopt a stricter criterion following a strong list than a weak list. Behavioral experiments support the differentiation account. The purpose of this study was to identify the neural bases for these differences. Encoding strength was manipulated (strong, weak) in a rapid event-related fMRI paradigm. To investigate the effect of retrieval context on foils, foils were presented in test blocks containing strong or weak targets. Imaging analyses identified regions in which activity increased faster for foils tested after a strong list than a weak list. The results are interpreted in support of a differentiation account of memory and are suggestive that the angular gyrus plays a role in evaluating evidence related to the memory decision, even for new items.},

It is therefore surprising that the link between event segmentation and the organization of experiences into episodes in memory has not been addressed. We found that after participants read narratives containing temporal event boundaries at varying locations in the narrative, their long-term associative memory for information across event boundaries was lower than their memory for information within an event. This suggests that event segmentation during encoding resulted in segmentation of those same events in memory. Further, functional imaging data revealed that, across participants, brain activity consistent with the ongoing integration of information within events correlated with this pattern of mnemonic segmentation. These data are the first to address the mechanisms that support the organization of experiences into episodes in long-term memory.},

	Abstract = {In recalling a list of previously experienced items, participants are known to organize their responses on the basis of the items' semantic and temporal similarities. Here, we examine how spatial information influences the organization of responses in free recall. In Experiment 1, participants studied and subsequently recalled lists of landmarks. In Experiment 2, participants played a game in which they delivered objects to landmarks in a virtual environment and later recalled the delivered objects. Participants in both experiments were simply asked to recall as many items as they could remember in any order. By analyzing the conditional probabilities of recall transitions, we demonstrate strong spatial and temporal organization of studied items in both experiments.

List-length was manipulated and probability of recall was influenced by target list-length but not by intervening list-length. Participants also performed free recall on control lists matched on target list-length. Critically, list-before-last recall was worse than recall on the control list, suggesting that the mere presence of an intervening list reduced recall. An examination of intrusion errors suggested that participants recalled both prior and intervening list intrusions and retrieval was influenced by the length of the intervening list-length. Finally, an examination of recall latency suggested that target list-length, but not intervening list-length, influenced recall dynamics. However, recall latency in list-before-last recall was longer than in the control lists, suggesting that the mere presence of intervening list influenced recall latency. Taken together, the results are consistent with the notion that in list-before-last recall participants rely on noisy contextual cues that activate both target and non-target items, leading to an increase in their search sets.},

@article{JangHube08,
	Abstract = {Three experiments used the "list-before-the-last" free recall paradigm (Shiffrin, 1970) to investigate retrieval for context and the manner in which context changes. This paradigm manipulates target and intervening list lengths to measure the interference from each list, providing a measure of list isolation. Correct target list recall was only affected by the target list length when participants engaged in recall between the lists, whereas there were effects of both list lengths with other activities. This suggests that the act of recalling drives context change, thus isolating the target list from interference. Correspondingly, incorrect recall of intervening list items was affected only by the length of the intervening list when recall occurred between the lists, but was otherwise affected by both list lengths. Concurrent with these changes in context similarity, there were apparent changes in context retrieval, as indicated by the overall levels of target retrieval versus intervening recall. A multinomial model of sampling and recovery was implemented to assess the adequacy of this account and to quantify context similarity and context retrieval.},

@article{RehaCapl11,
	Abstract = {In the presence of interference, recall of pairs can critically depend on the diagnostic power of memory of the order of items within the pair. Models of pair memory make different assumptions about whether and how such order information is stored, from convolution-based models, which assume no explicit storage of order, to matrix models and several models that assume a pair is learned by concatenating the representations of the constituent items, which lead to perfect within-pair order memory (given retrieval of the pair). Here we investigate memory for associations and within-pair order by examining the relationship between forward and backward probes of pairs subject to order-dependent associative interference in a double-function list paradigm. Associative interference disrupted the high correlation between forward and backward recall accuracy that is typically observed in standard paired-associate learning, challenging matrix and concatenation-based models. However, participants could overcome some interference due to within-pair order ambiguity, challenging directionally ambiguous convolution-based models. Unexpectedly, the test-retest correlation was reduced for pairs under the influence of interference compared to control pairs. This finding is incompatible with all existing implementations of the model classes we consider. Any model must include an assumption that order encoding (but not retrieval) is unreliable, and the form of this additional mechanism may depend intimately on how a given model is designed. In sum, our findings suggest that within-pair order memory is neither poor nor perfect, pointing to a fallible mechanism for within-pair order learning in verbal association-memory tasks.},

	Abstract = {Every day people make new choices between alternatives that they have never directly experienced. Yet, such decisions are often made rapidly and confidently. Here, we show that the hippocampus, traditionally known for its role in building long-term declarative memories, enables the spread of value across memories, thereby guiding decisions between new choice options. Using functional brain imaging in humans, we discovered that giving people monetary rewards led to activation of a preestablished network of memories, spreading the positive value of reward to nonrewarded items stored in memory. Later, people were biased to choose these nonrewarded items. This decision bias was predicted by activity in the hippocampus, reactivation of associated memories, and connectivity between memory and reward regions in the brain. These findings explain how choices among new alternatives emerge automatically from the associative mechanisms by which the brain builds memories. Further, our findings demonstrate a previously unknown role for the hippocampus in value-based decisions.},

	Abstract = {The ability to learn from feedback is a key component of adaptive behavior. This type of learning is traditionally thought to depend on neural substrates in the striatum and not on the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Here we show that in humans the MTL becomes necessary for feedback-based learning when feedback is delayed. Specifically, amnesic patients with MTL damage were impaired at probabilistic learning of cue-outcome associations when response-contingent feedback was delayed by a few seconds, but not when feedback was immediate. By contrast, patients with striatal dysfunction due to Parkinson's disease demonstrated the opposite pattern: impaired learning when trial-by-trial feedback was immediate but not when feedback was delayed, indicating that the striatum is necessary for learning only when feedback is immediate. Together, these results reveal that multiple complementary learning processes support what appears to be identical behavior in healthy individuals and point to an important role for the MTL in feedback-driven learning.},

	Abstract = {A recurring issue in neuroscience concerns evidence as to whether two or more brain regions implement qualitatively different functions. Here we introduce the application of state-trace analysis to measures of neural activity, illustrating how this analysis can furnish compelling evidence for qualitatively different functions, even when the precise "neurometric" mapping between function and brain measure is unknown. In doing so, we address a long-standing debate about the brain systems supporting human memory: whether the hippocampus and the perirhinal cortex, two key components of the medial temporal lobe memory system, provide qualitatively different contributions to recognition memory. An alternative account has been that both regions support a single shared function, such as memory strength, with the apparent dissociations obtained by previous neuroimaging studies merely reflecting different, nonlinear neurometric mappings across regions. To adjudicate between these scenarios, we analyze intracranial electroencephalographic data obtained directly from human hippocampus and perirhinal cortex during a recognition paradigm and apply state-trace analysis to responses evoked by the retrieval cue as a function of different types of memory judgment. Assuming only that the neurometric mapping in each region is monotonic, any unidimensional theory (such as the memory-strength account) will produce a monotonic state trace. Critically, results showed a nonmonotonic state trace; that is, activity levels in the two regions did not show the same relative ordering across memory conditions. This nonmonotonic state trace demonstrates that there are at least two different functions implemented across the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex, allowing formal rejection of a single-process account of medial temporal lobe contributions to recognition memory.},

	Abstract = {Recognition memory requires judgments of the previous occurrence of stimuli made on the basis of the relative familiarity of individual objects, or by integrating information concerning objects and location, or by using recency information. The present study examined the role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and perirhinal cortex (PRH) in these distinct recognition memory processes using a series of behavioral tests: a novel object preference task, an object-in-place task, and a temporal order memory task. Also, a disconnection procedure was used to test whether these regions form components of an integrated system for recognition memory. Male DA rats received bilateral lesions in the PRH or mPFC or unilateral lesions placed in both cortices in either the same (PRH-mPFC IPSI) or contralateral (PRH-mPFC CONTRA) hemispheres. A fifth group underwent sham surgery (SHAM). In the object-in-place and temporal order memory tasks, the PRH, mPFC, and PRH-mPFC CONTRA groups were significantly impaired. However, performance in the novel object preference task was only impaired in the PRH group. No group was impaired in the object location task. These results demonstrate that the mPFC and PRH are crucial for object-in-place associational and recency discriminations, whereas the PRH but not the mPFC is important for the discrimination of novel and familiar individual objects. Importantly, these results provide direct support for the hypothesis that to make discriminations based on associational or recency information, both cortical regions operate within an integrated neural network for recognition memory.},

	Abstract = {Theta and gamma frequency oscillations occur in the same brain regions and interact with each other, a process called cross-frequency coupling. Here, we review evidence for the following hypothesis: that the dual oscillations form a code for representing multiple items in an ordered way. This form of coding has been most clearly demonstrated in the hippocampus, where different spatial information is represented in different gamma subcycles of a theta cycle. Other experiments have tested the functional importance of oscillations and their coupling. These involve correlation of oscillatory properties with memory states, correlation with memory performance, and effects of disrupting oscillations on memory. Recent work suggests that this coding scheme coordinates communication between brain regions and is involved in sensory as well as memory processes.},

	Abstract = {Pigeons' ability to time light and tone stimuli was examined in four experiments. In Experiment 1, two groups of pigeons were trained to discriminate between 2- and 8-s durations of lights or tones and then were transferred to reversal or nonreversal discriminations in the alternate modality. Pigeons learned the light discrimination faster than the tone discrimination and showed immediate positive intermodal transfer from tone to light but not from light to tone. In Experiments 2-4, the peak procedure was used to study birds' timing of 15- and 30-s fixed-interval light and tone signals. Peak times on empty trials under baseline conditions closely approximated the length of fixed-interval signals. When pigeons were tested with time-outs and intermodal switches introduced midway through an empty trial, they tended to reset the timing mechanism and begin timing again from 0 s. With both estimation and production procedures, pigeons were less accurate when timing the tone stimuli than when timing the light stimuli. A comparison of these data with data from timing experiments with rats suggests several possible differences in timing processes between pigeons and rats.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus is believed to be an important structure for learning tasks that require temporal processing of information. The trace classical conditioning paradigm requires temporal processing because the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US) are temporally separated by an empty trace interval. The present study sought to determine whether the hippocampus was necessary for rats to perform a classical trace fear conditioning task in which each of 10 trials consisted of an auditory tone CS (1 5-s duration) followed by an empty 30-s trace interval and then a fear-producing floor-shock US (0.5-s duration). Several weeks prior to training, animals were anesthetized and given aspiration lesions of the neocortex (NEO; n = 6), hippocampus and overlying neocortex (HIPP; n = 7), or no lesions at all (control; n = 6). Approximately 24 h after trace conditioning, NEO and control animals showed a significant decrease in movement to a CS-alone presentation that was indicative of a conditioned fear response. Animals in the HIPP group did not show conditioned fear responses to the CS alone, nor did a pseudoconditioning group (n = 7) that was trained with unpaired CSs and USs. Furthermore, all groups except the HIPP group showed conditioned fear responses to the original context in which they received shock USs. One week later, HIPP, NEO, and control animals received delay fear-conditioning trials with no trace interval separating the CS and US. Six of seven HIPP animals could perform the delay version, but none could perform the trace version. This result suggests that the trace fear task is a reliable and useful model for examining the neural mechanisms of hippocampally dependent learning.},

	Abstract = {Involvement of the dorsal hippocampus (DHPC) in acquisition of Pavlovian trace conditioning and interval timing was examined in an appetitive preparation in which presentations of one conditioned stimulus (CS) were immediately followed by food (delay conditioning), and presentations of another CS were followed by food 15 seconds after its termination (trace conditioning). DHPC lesions did not disrupt acquisition of trace conditioning, but they selectively affected the distribution of conditioned responding over the course of the trace CS in the early stage of acquisition. In addition, lesions disrupted accuracy of timing the conditioned response (CR) for both delay and trace CSs: The control subjects showed maximum CR at the time of food delivery, but in the DHPC-lesioned subjects, the maximum CR was at an earlier time point. This timing deficit did not seem to be due to impulsive responding or deficits in response inhibition because, when the early portion of the delay CS was interrupted shortly by an empty interval, the difference in the time of maximum responding between the lesioned and control subjects was eliminated. Thus, although the involvement of the DHPC in appetitive trace conditioning was not found when a gross measure of conditioning was employed, it was revealed when the temporal distribution of conditioned responding was examined on a moment-by-moment basis as in eyeblink trace conditioning studies.},

	Abstract = {We report a series a three psychophysical experiments designed to differentiate the contributions of the neocerebellar and prefrontal cortex to time perception. Comparison of patients with focal, unilateral neocerebellar or prefrontal lesions on temporal discrimination of 400-ms and 4-s intervals (Expt. 1) indicated that neocerebellar damage impaired timing in both millisecond and seconds ranges, whereas prefrontal damage resulted in deficits that were robust only at the longer duration. Patients with prefrontal lesions, however, also exhibited working memory deficits on a non-temporal task (Expt. 2), biases in point of subjective equality indicative of attentional deficits, and were disproportionately sensitive to strategic manipulations in a long-duration discrimination task (Expt. 3). In contrast, the pervasive timing deficits of cerebellar patients were relatively insensitive to strategic support and could not be readily explained by general deficits in working memory or attention. These findings support the hypothesis that neocerebellar regions subserve a central timing mechanism, whereas the prefrontal cortex subserves supportive functions associated with the acquisition, maintenance, monitoring and organization of temporal representations in working memory. Such functions serve to bridge the output of the central timing mechanism with behavior. Together, these regions appear to participate in a working memory system involved in discrimination of durations extending from a few milliseconds to many seconds.},

Here we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neural coupling analyses that episodic future thinking reduces the rate of delay discounting through a modulation of neural decision-making and episodic future thinking networks. In addition to a standard control condition, real subject-specific episodic event cues were presented during a delay discounting task. Spontaneous episodic imagery during cue processing predicted how much subjects changed their preferences toward more future-minded choice behavior. Neural valuation signals in the anterior cingulate cortex and functional coupling of this region with hippocampus and amygdala predicted the degree to which future thinking modulated individual preference functions. A second experiment replicated the behavioral effects and ruled out alternative explanations such as date-based processing and temporal focus. The present data reveal a mechanism through which neural decision-making and prospection networks can interact to generate future-minded choice behavior.},

	Abstract = {The ability to learn from the consequences of actions--no matter when those consequences take place--is central to adaptive behavior. Despite major advances in understanding how immediate feedback drives learning, it remains unknown precisely how the brain learns from delayed feedback. Here, we present converging evidence from neuropsychology and neuroimaging for distinct roles for the striatum and the hippocampus in learning, depending on whether feedback is immediate or delayed. We show that individuals with striatal dysfunction due to Parkinson's disease are impaired at learning when feedback is immediate, but not when feedback is delayed by a few seconds. Using functional imaging (fMRI) combined with computational model-derived analyses, we further demonstrate that healthy individuals show activation in the striatum during learning from immediate feedback and activation in the hippocampus during learning from delayed feedback. Additionally, later episodic memory for delayed feedback events was enhanced, suggesting that engaging distinct neural systems during learning had consequences for the representation of what was learned. Together, these findings provide direct evidence from humans that striatal systems are necessary for learning from immediate feedback and that delaying feedback leads to a shift in learning from the striatum to the hippocampus. The results provide a link between learning impairments in Parkinson's disease and evidence from single-unit recordings demonstrating that the timing of reinforcement modulates activity of midbrain dopamine neurons. Collectively, these findings indicate that relatively small changes in the circumstances under which information is learned can shift learning from one brain system to another.},

	Abstract = {Behavior may be generated on the basis of many different kinds of learned contingencies. For instance, responses could be guided by the direct association between a stimulus and response, or by sequential stimulus-stimulus relationships (as in model-based reinforcement learning or goal-directed actions). However, the neural architecture underlying sequential predictive learning is not well understood, in part because it is difficult to isolate its effect on choice behavior. To track such learning more directly, we examined reaction times (RTs) in a probabilistic sequential picture identification task in healthy individuals. We used computational learning models to isolate trial-by-trial effects of two distinct learning processes in behavior, and used these as signatures to analyse the separate neural substrates of each process. RTs were best explained via the combination of two delta rule learning processes with different learning rates. To examine neural manifestations of these learning processes, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to seek correlates of time-series related to expectancy or surprise. We observed such correlates in two regions, hippocampus and striatum. By estimating the learning rates best explaining each signal, we verified that they were uniquely associated with one of the two distinct processes identified behaviorally. These differential correlates suggest that complementary anticipatory functions drive each region's effect on behavior. Our results provide novel insights as to the quantitative computational distinctions between medial temporal and basal ganglia learning networks and enable experiments that exploit trial-by-trial measurement of the unique contributions of both hippocampus and striatum to response behavior.},

We examined the contiguity effect in a probed recall task in which the correlation between the study context and the test context was disrupted. After study of several lists of words, participants were given probe words in a random order and were instructed to recall a word from the same list as the probe. The results showed both short-term and long-term contiguity effects. Because study order and test order are uncorrelated, these contiguity effects require a causal contiguity mechanism that operates across time scales.},

	Abstract = {Three facts of time perception are described based upon a temporal generalization task for rats (the peak procedure) in which food reinforcement is delivered on half the trials following the first lever-press response after some fixed interval after signal onset. (1) The mean response rate as a function of time is a smooth, slightly asymmetric, function with a maximum near the time of reinforcement; (2) the response rate on individual trials is characterized by an abrupt change from a state of low responding to a state of high responding and finally another state of low responding (break-run-break pattern); and (3) the mean response rate in 12-s and 20-s peak procedures is similar when plotted against time relative to the time of reinforcement (superposition). An information-processing version of scalar timing theory is described and compared to an alternative connectionist version of scalar timing theory that involves multiple oscillators and an autoassociation network. Psychological, mathematical and biological descriptions of the two versions are described and some possible extensions of the connectionist version are proposed to deal with perception of number, rate, and spatial orientation.},

	Abstract = {A. Machado and F. J. Silva have spotted an important conceptual problem in scalar expectancy theory's account of the 2-standard-interval time-left experiment. C. R. Gallistel and J. Gibbon (2000) were aware of it but did not discuss it for historical and sociological reasons, owned up to in this article. A problem of broader significance for psychology, cognitive science, neuroscience, and the philosophy of mind concerns the closely related concepts of a trial and of temporal pairing, which are foundational in associative theories of learning and memory. Association formation is assumed to depend on the temporal pairing of the to-be-associated events. In modeling it, theorists have assumed continuous time to be decomposable into trials. But life is not composed of trials, and attempts to specify the conditions under which two events may be regarded as temporally paired have never succeeded. Thus, associative theories of learning and memory are built on conceptual sand. Undeterred, neuroscientists have defined the neurobiology-of-memory problem as the problem of determining the cellular and molecular mechanism of association formation, and connectionist modelers have made it a cornerstone of their efforts. More conceptual analysis is indeed needed.},

	Abstract = {Interval schedules of reinforcement maintained pigeons' key-pecking in six experiments. Each schedule was specified in terms of mean interval, which determined the maximum rate of reinforcement possible, and distribution of intervals, which ranged from many-valued (variable-interval) to single-valued (fixed-interval). In Exp. 1, the relative durations of a sequence of intervals from an arithmetic progression were held constant while the mean interval was varied. Rate of responding was a monotonically increasing, negatively accelerated function of rate of reinforcement over a range from 8.4 to 300 reinforcements per hour. The rate of responding also increased as time passed within the individual intervals of a given schedule. In Exp. 2 and 3, several variable-interval schedules made up of different sequences of intervals were examined. In each schedule, the rate of responding at a particular time within an interval was shown to depend at least in part on the local rate of reinforcement at that time, derived from a measure of the probability of reinforcement at that time and the proximity of potential reinforcements at other times. The functional relationship between rate of responding and rate of reinforcement at different times within the intervals of a single schedule was similar to that obtained across different schedules in Exp. 1. Experiments 4, 5, and 6 examined fixed-interval and two-valued (mixed fixed-interval fixed-interval) schedules, and demonstrated that reinforcement at one time in an interval had substantial effects on responding maintained at other times. It was concluded that the rate of responding maintained by a given interval schedule depends not on the overall rate of reinforcement provided but rather on the summation of different local effects of reinforcement at different times within intervals.},

	Abstract = {Three experiments with pigeons are reported in which the scalar property in simultaneous timing tasks was studied. According to scalar expectancy theory, the scalar property should be maintained in simultaneous timing, but the behavioral theory of timing predicts that the scalar property should be evident only in independent timing. Experiment 1 showed that the appearance of distinct peaks at reinforcement times required about a 4:1 ratio between intervals. Experiment 2 (2-interval timing task) and Experiment 3 (3-interval timing task) used an individual trial analysis technique to examine high-rate responding segments bracketing the times of reinforcement. The standard deviations of the starting and stopping times of high-rate segments were linearly related to their means and to reinforcement time, supporting the scalar property in simultaneous timing.},

	Abstract = {Animals readily learn the timing between salient events. They can even adapt their timed responding to rapidly changing intervals, sometimes as quickly as a single trial. Recently, drift-diffusion models-widely used to model response times in decision making-have been extended with new learning rules that allow them to accommodate steady-state interval timing, including scalar timing and timescale invariance. These time-adaptive drift-diffusion models (TDDMs) work by accumulating evidence of elapsing time through their drift rate, thereby encoding the to-be-timed interval. One outstanding challenge for these models lies in the dynamics of interval timing-when the to-be-timed intervals are non-stationary. On these schedules, animals often fail to exhibit strict timescale invariance, as expected by the TDDMs and most other timing models. Here, we introduce a simple extension to these TDDMs, where the response threshold is a linear function of the observed event rate. This new model compares favorably against the basic TDDMs and the multiple-time-scale (MTS) habituation model when evaluated against three published datasets on timing dynamics in pigeons. Our results suggest that the threshold for triggering responding in interval timing changes as a function of recent intervals. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: SQAB 2012.},

	Abstract = {A key question in the neurobiology of reward relates to the nature of coding. Rewards are objects that are advantageous or necessary for the survival of individuals in a variety of environmental situations. Thus reward appears to depend on the individual and its environment. The question arises whether neuronal systems in humans and monkeys code reward in subjective terms, objective terms or both. The present review addresses this issue by dealing with two important reward processes, namely the individual discounting of reward value across temporal delays, and the processing of information about risky rewards that depends on individual risk attitudes. The subjective value of rewards decreases with the temporal distance to the reward. In experiments using neurophysiology and brain imaging, dopamine neurons and striatal systems discount reward value across temporal delays of a few seconds, despite unchanged objective reward value, suggesting subjective value coding. The subjective values of risky outcomes depend on the risk attitude of individual decision makers; these values decrease for risk-avoiders and increase for risk-seekers. The signal for risk and the signal for the value of risky reward covary with individual risk attitudes in regions of the human prefrontal cortex, suggesting subjective rather than objective coding of risk and risky value. These data demonstrate that important parameters of reward are coded in a subjective manner in key reward structures of the brain. However, these data do not rule out that other neurons or brain structures may code reward according to its objective value and risk.},

	Abstract = {The spiking activity of nearby cortical neurons is correlated on both short and long time scales. Understanding this shared variability in firing patterns is critical for appreciating the representation of sensory stimuli in ensembles of neurons, the coincident influences of neurons on common targets, and the functional implications of microcircuitry. Our knowledge about neuronal correlations, however, derives largely from experiments that used different recording methods, analysis techniques, and cortical regions. Here we studied the structure of neuronal correlation in area V4 of alert macaques using recording and analysis procedures designed to match those used previously in primary visual cortex (V1), the major input to V4. We found that the spatial and temporal properties of correlations in V4 were remarkably similar to those of V1, with two notable differences: correlated variability in V4 was approximately one-third the magnitude of that in V1 and synchrony in V4 was less temporally precise than in V1. In both areas, spontaneous activity (measured during fixation while viewing a blank screen) was approximately twice as correlated as visual-evoked activity. The results provide a foundation for understanding how the structure of neuronal correlation differs among brain regions and stages in cortical processing and suggest that it is likely governed by features of neuronal circuits that are shared across the visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {Although short-term plasticity is believed to play a fundamental role in cortical computation, empirical evidence bearing on its role during behavior is scarce. Here we looked for the signature of short-term plasticity in the fine-timescale spiking relationships of a simultaneously recorded population of physiologically identified pyramidal cells and interneurons, in the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat, in a working memory task. On broader timescales, sequentially organized and transiently active neurons reliably differentiated between different trajectories of the rat in the maze. On finer timescales, putative monosynaptic interactions reflected short-term plasticity in their dynamic and predictable modulation across various aspects of the task, beyond a statistical accounting for the effect of the neurons' co-varying firing rates. Seeking potential mechanisms for such effects, we found evidence for both firing pattern-dependent facilitation and depression, as well as for a supralinear effect of presynaptic coincidence on the firing of postsynaptic targets.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that emotional stimuli result in a higher proportion of recognized items that are "remembered" (e.g., Kensinger & Corkin, 2003; Ochsner, 2000), leading to greater estimates of recollection by the dual-process model (Yonelinas, 1994). This result suggests that recognition judgments to emotional stimuli depend on a recollection process. We challenge this conclusion with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve data from two experiments. In both experiments, subjects studied neutral and emotional words. During the recognition test, subjects made old-new confidence ratings as well as remember-know judgments. Four models of remember-know judgments were fit to individual subjects' data: two versions of a one-dimensional signal-detection-based model (Donaldson, 1996; Wixted & Stretch, 2004), the dual-process model (Yonelinas, 1994), and the two-dimensional signal-detection-based model known as STREAK (Rotello, Macmillan, & Reeder, 2004). Consistent with the literature, we found that emotion increases subjective reports of "remembering:" However, our ROC analyses and modeling work reveal that the effect is due to response bias differences rather than sensitivity change or use of a high-threshold recollection process.},

In contrast, younger adults respond "old" and "remember" more often to negative materials in recognition tests. For younger adults, both effects are due to response bias changes rather than to enhanced memory accuracy (S. Dougal & C. M. Rotello, 2007). We presented older and younger adults with emotional and neutral stimuli in a remember-know paradigm. Signal-detection and model-based analyses showed that memory accuracy did not differ for the neutral, negative, and positive stimuli, and that "remember" responses did not reflect the use of recollection. However, both age groups showed large and significant response bias effects of emotion: Younger adults tended to say "old" and "remember" more often in response to negative words than to positive and neutral words, whereas older adults responded "old" and "remember" more often to both positive and negative words than to neutral stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Are the information processing steps that support short-term sensory memory common to all the senses? Systematic, psychophysical comparison requires identical experimental paradigms and comparable stimuli, which can be challenging to obtain across modalities. Participants performed a recognition memory task with auditory and visual stimuli that were comparable in complexity and in their neural representations at early stages of cortical processing. The visual stimuli were static and moving Gaussian-windowed, oriented, sinusoidal gratings (Gabor patches); the auditory stimuli were broadband sounds whose frequency content varied sinusoidally over time (moving ripples). Parallel effects on recognition memory were seen for number of items to be remembered, retention interval, and serial position. Further, regardless of modality, predicting an item's recognizability requires taking account of (1) the probe's similarity to the remembered list items (summed similarity), and (2) the similarity between the items in memory (inter-item homogeneity). A model incorporating both these factors gives a good fit to recognition memory data for auditory as well as visual stimuli. In addition, we present the first demonstration of the orthogonality of summed similarity and inter-item homogeneity effects. These data imply that auditory and visual representations undergo very similar transformations while they are encoded and retrieved from memory.},

To examine the representation of recent visual experiences, we devised a novel procedure that measures episodic recognition memory for synthetic textures. On each trial, two brief study stimuli were followed by a probe, which either replicated one of the study stimuli or differed in spatial frequency from both. The probe's spatial frequency roved from trial to trial, testing recognition with a range of differences between probe and study items. Repeated testing of recognition generated mnemometric functions, snapshots of memory strength's distribution. The distributional characteristics of the mnemometric functions rule out several hypotheses about memory representation, including the hypothesis that representations are prototypes constructed from previously seen stimuli; instead, stimuli are represented in memory as noisy exemplars.},

Duncan Luce, p. 251-301, Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum). We apply a similar approach to the analysis of recognition memory. Using a version of short-term recognition paradigm (Sternberg, Science 153 (1966) 652), we asked whether NEMO Sternberg's, a noisy exemplar summed-similarity model, could account for variation in mean performance on individual trials. NEMO provided a very good overall fit to recognition data from three experiments. However, its failure to fit data for certain lists of stimuli suggested a revision of the summed-similarity assumption. Our model-based analysis showed that subjects used interitem similarity, in addition to probe-item similarity, as the basis for their decisions. This represents a major departure from existing recognition models that assume subjects' judgments depend exclusively on the summed similarity of the probe to the study items.},

	Abstract = {Cortical neurons show irregular but structured spike trains. This has been interpreted as evidence for 'temporal coding', whereby stimuli are represented by precise spike-timing patterns. Here, we suggest an alternative interpretation based on the older concept of the cell assembly. The dynamic evolution of assembly sequences, which are steered but not deterministically controlled by sensory input, is the proposed substrate of psychological processes beyond simple stimulus-response associations. Accordingly, spike trains show a temporal structure that is stimulus-dependent and more variable than would be predicted by strict sensory control. We propose four signatures of assembly organization that can be experimentally tested. We argue that many observations that have been interpreted as evidence for temporal coding might instead reflect an underlying assembly structure.},

	Abstract = {Competitive synchronization among synfire chains may model the dynamics of binding and compositionality. Typically, such models require simulations of hundreds of thousands of neurons. Here we show that the behavior of such large systems can be numerically analyzed by representing the neuronal activity in a synfire chain as a wave. The position and velocity of waves are the only parameters needed to represent the neural activity within a synfire chain. With this wave model we describe how waves are generated, decay, interact within a single chain and among chains. The behavior of the wave model is compared to the behavior of detailed simulations of synfire chains with no qualitative difference. We show that interacting waves tend to become locked to each other (wave synchronization). Finally we prove that: (1) Within a system of many synfire chains with symmetric interchain connections, as long as waves do not fade away or become fully synchronized, the total synchrony among waves can only increase (or stay constant), but never decrease. (2) A wave that increases its speed during the synchronization process becomes more stable.},

@article{BangEtal06,
	Abstract = {Trace conditioning, a form of classical conditioning in which the presentation of the conditioned stimulus (CS) and the unconditioned stimulus (US) is separated in time by an interstimulus interval, requires an intact hippocampus. In contrast, classical conditioning procedures in which the CS and US are not separated by an interstimulus interval (i.e., delay conditioning procedures) typically do not (Solomon et al., 1986). However, why trace conditioning is dependent on the hippocampus is unknown. Several theories suggest that it is specifically the discontiguity between the CS and US in trace conditioning that critically engages the hippocampus. However, there are other explanations that do not depend on discontiguity. To determine whether the lack of contiguity renders trace conditioning hippocampal dependent, we designed a "contiguous trace conditioning" (CTC) paradigm in which CS-US contiguity is restored by re-presenting the CS simultaneously with the US. Although rats with excitotoxic lesions of the hippocampus could not learn a standard trace fear-conditioning paradigm, lesioned rats trained on CTC showed significant conditioning, at levels similar to those with sham surgeries. Importantly, lesioned rats trained solely with simultaneous CS-US presentations did not demonstrate conditioning. Together, these data suggest that rats with hippocampal lesions can form a memory of a trace CS-US association when contiguity is restored. Therefore, the dependence of traditional trace paradigms on the hippocampus can be attributed to the absence of temporal contiguity.},

@article{MaasEtal02,
	Abstract = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

	Abstract = {In this article, we present a perspective on the role of the hippocampal system in generalization, instantiated in a computational model called REMERGE (recurrency and episodic memory results in generalization). We expose a fundamental, but neglected, tension between prevailing computational theories that emphasize the function of the hippocampus in pattern separation (Marr, 1971; McClelland, McNaughton, & O'Reilly, 1995), and empirical support for its role in generalization and flexible relational memory (Cohen & Eichenbaum, 1993; Eichenbaum, 1999). Our account provides a means by which to resolve this conflict, by demonstrating that the basic representational scheme envisioned by complementary learning systems theory (McClelland et al., 1995), which relies upon orthogonalized codes in the hippocampus, is compatible with efficient generalization-as long as there is recurrence rather than unidirectional flow within the hippocampal circuit or, more widely, between the hippocampus and neocortex. We propose that recurrent similarity computation, a process that facilitates the discovery of higher-order relationships between a set of related experiences, expands the scope of classical exemplar-based models of memory (e.g., Nosofsky, 1984) and allows the hippocampus to support generalization through interactions that unfold within a dynamically created memory space.},

	Abstract = {Empirical research and theoretical accounts have traditionally emphasized the function of the hippocampus in episodic memory. Here we draw attention to the importance of the hippocampus to generalization, and focus on the neural representations and computations that might underpin its role in tasks such as the paired associate inference (PAI) paradigm. We make a principal distinction between two different mechanisms by which the hippocampus may support generalization: an encoding-based mechanism that creates overlapping representations which capture higher-order relationships between different items [e.g., Temporal Context Model (TCM): Howard et al., 2005]-and a retrieval-based model [Recurrence with Episodic Memory Results in Generalization (REMERGE): Kumaran and McClelland, in press] that effectively computes these relationships at the point of retrieval, through a recurrent mechanism that allows the dynamic interaction of multiple pattern separated episodic codes. We also discuss what we refer to as transfer effects-a more abstract example of generalization that has also been linked to the function of the hippocampus. We consider how this phenomenon poses inherent challenges for models such as TCM and REMERGE, and outline the potential applicability of a separate class of models-hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) in this context. Our hope is that this article will provide a basic framework within which to consider the theoretical mechanisms underlying the role of the hippocampus in generalization, and at a minimum serve as a stimulus for future work addressing issues that go to the heart of the function of the hippocampus.},

	Abstract = {Atkinson and Shiffrin's (1968) dual-store model of memory includes structural aspects of memory along with control processes. The rehearsal buffer is a process by which items are kept in mind and long-term episodic traces are formed. The model has been both influential and controversial. Here, we describe a novel variant of Atkinson and Shiffrin's buffer model within the framework of the retrieving effectively from memory theory (REM; Shiffrin & Steyvers, 1997) that accounts for findings previously thought to be difficult for such models to explain. This model assumes a limited-capacity buffer where information is stored about items, along with information about associations between items and between items and the context in which they are studied. The strength of association between items and context is limited by the number of items simultaneously occupying the buffer (Lehman & Malmberg, 2009). The contents of the buffer are managed by complementary processes of rehearsal and compartmentalization (Lehman & Malmberg, 2011). New findings that directly test a priori predictions of the model are reported, including serial position effects and conditional and first recall probabilities in immediate and delayed free recall, in a continuous distractor paradigm, and in experiments using list-length manipulations of single-item and paired-item study lists.

	Abstract = {The influence of temporal association on the representation and recognition of objects was investigated. Observers were shown sequences of novel faces in which the identity of the face changed as the head rotated. As a result, observers showed a tendency to treat the views as if they were of the same person. Additional experiments revealed that this was only true if the training sequences depicted head rotations rather than jumbled views; in other words, the sequence had to be spatially as well as temporally smooth. Results suggest that we are continuously associating views of objects to support later recognition, and that we do so not only on the basis of the physical similarity, but also the correlated appearance in time of the objects.},

The rats were given CA1, CA3, or control lesions prior to learning the object-trace-odor task. Rats were presented with an object for 10 s, after which the object was removed, followed by a 10-s trace period, followed by the presentation of an odor 50 cm away. If the odor and the object were paired, rats were to dig in the odor cup for a reward. If unpaired, rats were to refrain from digging. Rats that had CA1 lesions were unable to make the association, whereas rats that had CA3 lesions performed as well as controls. These results support the idea that the hippocampus is involved in forming arbitrary associations that do not necessarily involve space as long as they involve a temporal component.},

	Abstract = {Recent theoretical models of hippocampal function suggest that the hippocampus plays a critical role in the memory for the overlapping sequences of events that comprise episodic memory. Consistent with this idea, the firing of hippocampal "place cells" have been shown to represent not only location, but also the context or episode in which the location occurs. Thus, hippocampal neurons fire differently in the same location depending on the particular journey or sequence of places in which the subject is traveling. Further, recent work in rats has shown that hippocampal lesions impair memory for sequences of odors and the ability to disambiguate overlapping sequences of odors. We therefore recorded the activity of hippocampal complex-spike cells during a disambiguation of odor sequences task in which the two sequences shared three common odors. Consistent with data from spatial memory tasks, we found that 26 of 44 complex-spike cells fired differentially in the periods before, or during the presentation of the ambiguous odors depending on the sequence in which the odors were presented. This finding further supports the idea that the hippocampus is critical for episodic memory, and extends the physiological evidence to suggest that the hippocampal neurons play a broader role representing sequences of both spatial and nonspatial information.},

	Abstract = {Memory lets the past inform the present so that we can attain future goals. In many species, these abilities require the hippocampus. Recent experiments, in which memory demand was varied while overt behavior and the environment were kept constant, have revealed firing patterns of hippocampal neurons that corresponded with memory demands and predicted performance. Although the active population appeared to be 'place cells' that signalled location, it actually included cells the activity patterns of which distinguished the recent or pending history of behavior during identical actions that occurred in the same place. Different populations of hippocampal cells fired as a rat walked along the same spatial path on the way to different goals, and coded past, present and pending events. Other experiments provide converging data that neuronal activity is modulated by goal-directed behavioral episodes. Together, these firing patterns suggest a testable mechanism of episodic memory coding: that hippocampal dynamics encode a temporally extended, hierarchically organized representation of goal-directed behavior.},

	Abstract = {Groundbreaking research in animals has demonstrated that the hippocampus contains neurons that distinguish between overlapping navigational trajectories. These hippocampal neurons respond selectively to the context of specific episodes despite interference from overlapping memory representations. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging in humans to examine the role of the hippocampus and related structures when participants need to retrieve contextual information to navigate well learned spatial sequences that share common elements. Participants were trained outside the scanner to navigate through 12 virtual mazes from a ground-level first-person perspective. Six of the 12 mazes shared overlapping components. Overlapping mazes began and ended at distinct locations, but converged in the middle to share some hallways with another maze. Non-overlapping mazes did not share any hallways with any other maze. Successful navigation through the overlapping hallways required the retrieval of contextual information relevant to the current navigational episode. Results revealed greater activation during the successful navigation of the overlapping mazes compared with the non-overlapping mazes in regions typically associated with spatial and episodic memory, including the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. When combined with previous research, the current findings suggest that an anatomically integrated system including the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex is critical for the contextually dependent retrieval of well learned overlapping navigational routes.},

	Abstract = {One important aspect of episodic memory is the ability to remember the order in which events occurred. Memory for sequences in rats and has been shown to rely on the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (DeVito and Eichenbaum (2011) J Neuro 31:3169-3175; Fortin et al. (2002) Nat Neuro 5:458-462). Rats with hippocampal lesions were impaired in selecting the odor that had appeared earlier in a sequence of five odors but were not impaired in recognition of previously sampled odors (Fortin et al., 2002; Kesner et al. (2002) Behav Neuro 116:286-290). These results suggest that order is not represented by relative familiarity or memory strength. However, the cognitive mechanisms underlying memory for order have not been determined. We presented monkeys with lists of five images drawn randomly from a pool of 6,000 images. At test, two images were presented and monkeys were rewarded for selecting the image that had appeared earlier in the studied list. Monkeys learned to discriminate the order of the images, even those that were consecutive in the studied list. In subsequent experiments, we found that discrimination of order was not controlled by list position or relative memory strength. Instead, monkeys used temporal order, a mechanism that appears to encode order of occurrence relative to other events, rather than in absolute time. We found that number of intervening images, rather than passage of time per se, most strongly determined the discriminability of order of occurrence. Better specifying the cognitive mechanisms nonhuman primates use to remember the order of events enhances this animal model of episodic memory, and may further inform our understanding of the functions of the hippocampus. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {Imaging, electrophysiological studies, and lesion work have shown that the medial temporal lobe (MTL) is important for episodic memory; however, it is unclear whether different MTL regions support the spatial, temporal, and item elements of episodic memory. In this study we used fMRI to examine retrieval performance emphasizing different aspects of episodic memory in the context of a spatial navigation paradigm. Subjects played a taxi-driver game ("yellowcab"), in which they freely searched for passengers and delivered them to specific landmark stores. Subjects then underwent fMRI scanning as they retrieved landmarks, spatial, and temporal associations from their navigational experience in three separate runs. Consistent with previous findings on item memory, perirhinal cortex activated most strongly during landmark retrieval compared with spatial or temporal source information retrieval. Both hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex activated significantly during retrieval of landmarks, spatial associations, and temporal order. We found, however, a significant dissociation between hippocampal and parahippocampal cortex activations, with spatial retrieval leading to greater parahippocampal activation compared with hippocampus and temporal order retrieval leading to greater hippocampal activation compared with parahippocampal cortex. Our results, coupled with previous findings, demonstrate that the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex are preferentially recruited during temporal order and spatial association retrieval--key components of episodic "source" memory.},

	Abstract = {Recent neuroimaging studies have successfully identified encoding mechanisms that support different forms of subsequent episodic recognition memory. In our everyday lives, however, much of our episodic memory retrieval is accomplished by means of free recall, i.e., retrieval without an external recognition cue. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the encoding mechanisms that support later free recall and their relationship to those that support different forms of later recognition memory. First, in agreement with previous work, we found that activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus and hippocampus correlated with later associative/relational recognition. In these regions, activation was further enhanced for items later freely recalled, pointing to shared underlying relational encoding mechanisms whose magnitude of activation differentiates later successful free recall from successful associative recognition. Critically, we also found evidence for free recall-specific encoding mechanisms that did not, in our paradigm, support later associative recognition compared with item recognition. These free recall-specific effects were observed in left mid/dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) and bilateral posterior parietal cortices (PPC). We speculate that the higher-level working memory operations associated with DLPFC and attention to internal mnemonic representations perhaps mediated via PPC may serve to embed an item into a rich associative network during encoding that facilitates later access to the item. Finally, activation in the perirhinal cortex correlated with successful associative binding regardless of the form of later memory, i.e., recognition or free recall, providing novel evidence for the role of the perirhinal cortex in episodic intra-item encoding.},

	Abstract = {Memory for the order of events within an episode requires mechanisms capable of bridging gaps between those events and laying down memory traces that will support the subsequent retrieval of episodic sequence information. It has been proposed that the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe (MTL) play a critical role in these processes. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined MTL activation during the encoding of sequentially presented noun triplets. Using performance on a retrieval test, encoding activations predictive of subsequent triplet recognition ("hits" vs. "misses") as well as activations differentiating triplets that were subsequently recognized with (ordered) and without (misordered) memory for the original sequence of presentation were identified. Within the MTL, activations in bilateral hippocampal and parahippocampal cortical regions predicted subsequent order memory, with greater activations observed during encoding of triplets subsequently correctly ordered than those subsequently misordered. Interestingly, activation in these regions did not correlate with old/new triplet identification, suggesting that these MTL regions contributed specifically to encoding of episodic details supporting subsequent recovery of sequence information.},

@article{MarrHild80,
	Abstract = {A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of delta 2G(x,y)*I(x,y) for image I, where G(x,y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and delta 2 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround delta 2G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979).},

	Abstract = {The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has an important role in many cognitive behaviours; however, the neural circuit dynamics underlying PPC function are not well understood. Here we optically imaged the spatial and temporal activity patterns of neuronal populations in mice performing a PPC-dependent task that combined a perceptual decision and memory-guided navigation in a virtual environment. Individual neurons had transient activation staggered relative to one another in time, forming a sequence of neuronal activation spanning the entire length of a task trial. Distinct sequences of neurons were triggered on trials with opposite behavioural choices and defined divergent, choice-specific trajectories through a state space of neuronal population activity. Cells participating in the different sequences and at distinct time points in the task were anatomically intermixed over microcircuit length scales (<100 micrometres). During working memory decision tasks, the PPC may therefore perform computations through sequence-based circuit dynamics, rather than long-lived stable states, implemented using anatomically intermingled microcircuits.},

Patterns of cortical activity associated with the study of three categories of pictures (faces, locations, and objects) were identified by a pattern-classification algorithm. The algorithm was used to track the reappearance of these activity patterns during the recall period. The reappearance of a given category's activity pattern correlates with verbal recalls made from that category and precedes the recall event by several seconds. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that category-specific activity is cueing the memory system to retrieve studied items.},

Recently, researchers have started to address this question by applying sophisticated pattern-classification algorithms to distributed (multi-voxel) patterns of functional MRI data, with the goal of decoding the information that is represented in the subject's brain at a particular point in time. This multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach has led to several impressive feats of mind reading. More importantly, MVPA methods constitute a useful new tool for advancing our understanding of neural information processing. We review how researchers are using MVPA methods to characterize neural coding and information processing in domains ranging from visual perception to memory search.},

In brain structures that support such memories, a neural code should exist that represents when or how long ago events occurred. Here we describe a neuronal coding mechanism in hippocampus that can be used to represent the recency of an experience over intervals of hours to days. When the same event is repeated after such time periods, the activity patterns of hippocampal CA1 cell populations progressively differ with increasing temporal distances. Coding for space and context is nonetheless preserved. Compared with CA1, the firing patterns of hippocampal CA3 cell populations are highly reproducible, irrespective of the time interval, and thus provide a stable memory code over time. Therefore, the neuronal activity patterns in CA1 but not CA3 include a code that can be used to distinguish between time intervals on an extended scale, consistent with behavioral studies showing that the CA1 area is selectively required for temporal coding over such periods.},

Except for working memory, where extracellular recordings have shown persistent discharges during delay-response tasks, it has been difficult to link memories with changes in individual neurons or specific synaptic connections. We found that transient stimuli are reliably encoded in the ongoing activity of brain tissue in vitro. Patterns of synaptic input onto dentate hilar neurons predicted which of four pathways were stimulated with an accuracy of 76% and performed significantly better than chance for >15 s. Dentate gyrus neurons were also able to accurately encode temporal sequences using population representations that were robust to variation in sequence interval. These results demonstrate direct neural encoding of temporal sequences in the spontaneous activity of brain tissue and suggest a local circuit mechanism that may contribute to diverse forms of short-term memory.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that the caudal medial entorhinal cortex (cMEC) is specialized for path integration and spatial navigation. However, cMEC is part of a brain system that supports episodic memory for both spatial and nonspatial events, and so may play a role in memory function that goes beyond navigation. Here, we used receiver operating characteristic analysis to investigate the role of the cMEC in familiarity and recollection processes that underlie nonspatial recognition memory in rats. The results indicate that cMEC plays a critical and selective role in recollection-based performance, supporting the view that cMEC supports memory for the spatial and temporal context in which events occur.},

	Abstract = {During pauses in exploration, ensembles of place cells in the rat hippocampus re-express firing sequences corresponding to recent spatial experience. Such "replay" co-occurs with ripple events: short-lasting (approximately 50-120 ms), high-frequency (approximately 200 Hz) oscillations that are associated with increased hippocampal-cortical communication. In previous studies, rats exploring small environments showed replay anchored to the rat's current location and compressed in time into a single ripple event. Here, we show, using a neural decoding approach, that firing sequences corresponding to long runs through a large environment are replayed with high fidelity and that such replay can begin at remote locations on the track. Extended replay proceeds at a characteristic virtual speed of approximately 8 m/s and remains coherent across trains of ripple events. These results suggest that extended replay is composed of chains of shorter subsequences, which may reflect a strategy for the storage and flexible expression of memories of prolonged experience.},

	Abstract = {Recent work has shown that lesions of the hippocampus in monkeys cause deficits in the capacity to remember increasing numbers of objects, colors, and spatial locations (). However, others have observed that hippocampectomized monkeys can show intact memory for a list of objects or locations (). We wished to explore the effects of hippocampal damage on the capacity of memory in the rodent and, to do so, developed novel "span" tasks in which a variable number of odors or locations had to be remembered. In the odor span task (experiment 1), rats were trained on a nonmatching to sample task in which increasing numbers of odors had to be remembered. Half of the trained rats received ibotenic acid lesions of the hippocampus. Postoperatively, hippocampectomized animals did not differ from control animals even when required to remember up to 24 odors. However, when tested on delayed retention of a list of 12 odors, rats with hippocampal lesions were impaired at a long delay. Also, these rats were impaired on a subsequent test of delayed spatial alternation. In a spatial span task (experiment 2), naive rats were trained on a nonmatching to sample task in which a variable number of locations had to be remembered. After this, half of the animals received ibotenic acid lesions. Postoperatively, hippocampectomized animals performed above chance levels when required to remember a single cup location, but were unable to remember more. Subsequent testing on another spatial delayed alternation task suggested that hippocampectomized rats could recognize, but could not inhibit their approach to previously visited locations.},

	Abstract = {The anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus contains a high percentage of head-direction cells whose activities are correlated with an animal's directional heading in the horizontal plane. The firing of head-direction cells could involve self-sustaining reverberating activity in a recurrent network, but the thalamus by itself lacks strong excitatory recurrent synaptic connections to sustain tonic reverberating activity. Here we examined whether a single thalamic neuron could sustain its own activity without synaptic input by recording from individual neurons from anterodorsal thalamus in brain slices with synaptic blockers. We found that the rebound firing induced by hyperpolarizing pulses often decayed slowly so that a thalamic neuron could keep on firing for many minutes after stimulation. The hyperpolarization-induced persistent firing rate was graded under repeated current injections, and could be enhanced by serotonin. The effect of depolarizing pulses was much weaker and only slightly accelerated the decay of the hyperpolarization-induced persistent firing. Our finding provides the first direct evidence for single-cell persistent activity in the thalamus, supporting the notion that cellular mechanisms at the slow time scale of minutes might potentially contribute to the operations of the head-direction system.},

	Abstract = {Multiple memory systems are distinguished by different sets of neuronal circuits and operating principles optimized to solve different problems across mammalian species (Tulving and Schacter, 1994). When a rat selects an arm in a plus maze, for example, the choice can be guided by distinct neural systems (White and Wise, 1999) that encode different relationships among perceived stimuli, actions, and reward. Thus, egocentric or stimulus-response associations require striatal circuits, whereas spatial or episodic learning requires hippocampal circuits (Packard et al., 1989). Although these memory systems function in parallel (Packard and McGaugh, 1996), they can also interact competitively or synergistically (Kim and Ragozzino, 2005). The neuronal mechanisms that coordinate these multiple memory systems are not fully known, but converging evidence suggests that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is central. The PFC is crucial for abstract, rule-guided behavior in primates and for switching rapidly between memory strategies in rats. We now report that rat medial PFC neuronal activity predicts switching between hippocampus- and caudate-dependent memory strategies. Prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) neuronal activity changed as rats switched memory strategies even as the rats performed identical behaviors but did not change when rats learned new contingencies using the same strategy. PL dynamics anticipated learning performance whereas IL lagged, suggesting that the two regions help initiate and establish new strategies, respectively. These neuronal dynamics suggest that the PFC contributes to the coordination of memory strategies by integrating the predictive relationships among stimuli, actions, and reward.},

	Abstract = {Place-selective activity in hippocampal neurons can be modulated by the trajectory that will be taken in the immediate future ("prospective coding"), information that could be useful in neural processes elaborating choices in route planning. To determine if and how hippocampal prospective neurons participate in decision making, we measured the time course of the evolution of prospective activity by recording place responses in rats performing a T-maze alternation task. After five or seven alternation trials, the routine was unpredictably interrupted by a photodetector-triggered visual cue as the rat crossed the middle of central arm, signaling it to suddenly change its intended choice. Comparison of the delays between light cue presentation and the onset of prospective activity for neurons with firing fields at various locations after the trigger point revealed a 420 ms processing delay. This surprisingly long delay indicates that prospective activity in the hippocampus appears much too late to generate planning or decision signals. This provides yet another example of a prominent brain activity that is unlikely to play a functional role in the cognitive function that it appears to represent (planning future trajectories). Nonetheless, the hippocampus may provide other contextual information to areas active at the earliest stages of selecting future paths, which would then return signals that help establish hippocampal prospective activity. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus encodes both spatial and nonspatial aspects of a rat's ongoing behavior at the single-cell level. In this study, we examined the encoding of intended destination by hippocampal (CA1) place cells during performance of a serial reversal task on a double Y-maze. On the maze, rats had to make two choices to access one of four possible goal locations, two of which contained reward. Reward locations were kept constant within blocks of 10 trials but changed between blocks, and the session of each day comprised three or more trial blocks. A disproportionate number of place fields were observed in the start box and beginning stem of the maze, relative to other locations on the maze. Forty-six percent of these place fields had different firing rates on journeys to different goal boxes. Another group of cells had place fields before the second choice point, and, of these, 44% differentiated between journeys to specific goal boxes. In a second experiment, we observed that rats with hippocampal damage made significantly more errors than control rats on the Y-maze when reward locations were reversed. Together, these results suggest that, at the start of the maze, the hippocampus encodes both current location and the intended destination of the rat, and this encoding is necessary for the flexible response to changes in reinforcement contingencies.},

	Abstract = {In a continuous T-maze spatial alternation task, CA1 place cells fire differentially on the stem of the maze as rats are performing left- and right-turn trials (Wood et al. (2000) Neuron 27:623-633). This context-dependent hippocampal activity provides a potential mechanism by which animals could solve the alternation task, as it provides a cue that could prime the appropriate goal choice. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between context-dependent hippocampal activity and spatial alternation behavior. We report that rats with complete lesions of the hippocampus learn and perform the spatial alternation task as well as controls if there is no delay between trials, suggesting that the observed context-dependent hippocampal activity does not mediate alternation behavior in this task. However lesioned rats are significantly impaired when delays of 2 or 10 s are interposed. Recording experiments reveal that context-dependent hippocampal activity occurs in both the delay and no-delay versions of the task, but that in the delay version it occurs during the delay period, and not on the stem of the maze. These data are consistent with a role for context-dependent hippocampal activity in delayed spatial alternation, but suggest that, according to specific task demands and memory load, the activity may be generated by different mechanisms and/or in different brain structures.},

	Abstract = {Learning sequences of events (e.g., a-b-c) is conceptually a simple problem that can be solved using asymmetrically linked cell assemblies [e.g., "phase sequences" (Hebb, 1949)], provided that the elements of the sequence are unique. When elements repeat within the sequence, however (e.g., a-b-c-d-b-e), the same element belongs to two separate "contexts," and a more complex sequence encoding mechanism is required to differentiate between the two contexts. Some neural structure must form sequential-context-dependent, or "differential," representations of the two contexts (i.e., b as an element of "a-b-c" as opposed to "d-b-e") to allow the correct choice to be made after the repeated element. To investigate the possible role of hippocampus in complex sequence encoding, rats were trained to remember repeated-location sequences under three conditions: (1) reward was given at each location; (2) during training, moveable barriers were placed at the entry and exit of the repeated segment to direct the rat and were removed once the sequence was learned; and (3) reward was withheld at the entry and exit of the repeated segment. In the first condition, hippocampal ensemble activity did not differentiate the sequential context of the repeated segment, indicating that complex sequences with repeated segments can be learned without differential encoding within the hippocampus. Differential hippocampal encoding was observed, however, under the latter two conditions, suggesting that long-term memory for discriminative cues present only during training, working memory of the most recently visited reinforcement sites, or anticipation of the subsequent reinforcement site can separate hippocampal activity patterns at the same location.},

	Abstract = {Animals are capable of navigation even in the absence of prominent landmark cues. This behavioral demonstration of path integration is supported by the discovery of place cells and other neurons that show path-invariant response properties even in the dark. That is, under suitable conditions, the activity of these neurons depends primarily on the spatial location of the animal regardless of which trajectory it followed to reach that position. Although many models of path integration have been proposed, no known single theoretical framework can formally accommodate their diverse computational mechanisms. Here we derive a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a general class of systems that performs exact path integration. These conditions include multiplicative modulation by velocity inputs and a path-invariance condition that limits the structure of connections in the underlying neural network. In particular, for a linear system to satisfy the path-invariance condition, the effective synaptic weight matrices under different velocities must commute. Our theory subsumes several existing exact path integration models as special cases. We use entorhinal grid cells as an example to demonstrate that our framework can provide useful guidance for finding unexpected solutions to the path integration problem. This framework may help constrain future experimental and modeling studies pertaining to a broad class of neural integration systems.},

We assess performance in a two-alternative forced-choice recognition memory task with confidence ratings. The key manipulation is that sometimes participants are asked which of two new items is old, and the resulting confidence distribution is unambiguously interpreted as arising from a guessing state. The confidence ratings for other conditions are seemingly the resultant of mixing this stable guessing state with an additional stable detect state. Formal model comparison supports this observation, and an analysis of associated response times reveals a mixture signature as well.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the development of the neural circuits subserving specific cognitive functions such as navigation remains a central problem in neuroscience. Here, we characterize the development of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex, which, by nature of their regularly spaced firing fields, are thought to provide a distance metric to the hippocampal neural representation of space. Grid cells emerge at the time of weaning in the rat, at around 3 weeks of age. We investigated whether grid cells in young rats are functionally equivalent to those observed in the adult as soon as they appear, or if instead they follow a gradual developmental trajectory. We find that, from the very youngest ages at which reproducible grid firing is observed (postnatal day 19): grid cells display adult-like firing fields that tessellate to form a coherent map of the local environment; that this map is universal, maintaining its internal structure across different environments; and that grid cells in young rats, as in adults, also encode a representation of direction and speed. To further investigate the developmental processes leading up to the appearance of grid cells, we present data from individual medial entorhinal cortex cells recorded across more than 1 day, spanning the period before and after the grid firing pattern emerged. We find that increasing spatial stability of firing was correlated with increasing gridness.},

	Abstract = {Spatial scaling of place specific activity in the hippocampus varies systematically from the septal pole (high resolution) to the temporal pole (low resolution). Place fields get progressively larger, and the probability of observing a field in a given environment gets progressively smaller. It was previously found that decoupling movement in space from ambulation, by having the animal actively ride on a mobile platform, results in marked enlargement of the spatial scale factor in the dorsal hippocampus and a reduction in the increase in theta rhythm power with running speed, suggesting that a self-motion signal determines the spatial scale at which the hippocampal population vector updates. These results led to the hypothesis that the gain of the self-motion signal may vary systematically along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus. To test this hypothesis, EEG theta rhythm and ensembles of CA1 pyramidal cells and interneurons were recorded from the extreme dorsal and middle portions of the hippocampus. Pyramidal cell population vectors representing successive locations became decorrelated over substantially shorter distances in the dorsal than in the middle hippocampus. Dorsal pyramidal cells had smaller place fields, higher mean and peak firing rates, and higher intrinsic oscillation frequencies during track running than that of middle pyramidal cells. Both dorsal pyramidal cells and interneurons had more elevated mean rates during running, compared with rest, than that of the corresponding cell classes in the middle hippocampus, and both cell classes increased their rates more as a function of speed in the dorsal hippocampus.The amplitude, but not the frequency of fissure recorded theta rhythm, increased more as a function of running speed in the dorsal than in the middle hippocampus. We conclude that variation in the neuronal response to movement speed is the likely basis for the systematic variation in spatial scaling along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus.},

	Abstract = {We expand upon our proposal that the oscillatory interference mechanism proposed for the phase precession effect in place cells underlies the grid-like firing pattern of dorsomedial entorhinal grid cells (O'Keefe and Burgess (2005) Hippocampus 15:853-866). The original one-dimensional interference model is generalized to an appropriate two-dimensional mechanism. Specifically, dendritic subunits of layer II medial entorhinal stellate cells provide multiple linear interference patterns along different directions, with their product determining the firing of the cell. Connection of appropriate speed- and direction-dependent inputs onto dendritic subunits could result from an unsupervised learning rule which maximizes postsynaptic firing (e.g. competitive learning). These inputs cause the intrinsic oscillation of subunit membrane potential to increase above theta frequency by an amount proportional to the animal's speed of running in the "preferred" direction. The phase difference between this oscillation and a somatic input at theta-frequency essentially integrates velocity so that the interference of the two oscillations reflects distance traveled in the preferred direction. The overall grid pattern is maintained in environmental location by phase reset of the grid cell by place cells receiving sensory input from the environment, and environmental boundaries in particular. We also outline possible variations on the basic model, including the generation of grid-like firing via the interaction of multiple cells rather than via multiple dendritic subunits. Predictions of the interference model are given for the frequency composition of EEG power spectra and temporal autocorrelograms of grid cell firing as functions of the speed and direction of running and the novelty of the environment.},

Abstract:	 The role of inhibition and importance of local inhibitory microcircuits in spatial navigation are poorly understood. For layer 2 medial entorhinal cortex (L2 mEC) stellate cells, we report a gradient of decreasing inhibitory input along the dorso-ventral axis with medio-lateral asymmetry. A computational model of recurrent coupling in layer 2 suggests that this gradient of inhibition can account for the different properties of spatially modulated firing fields along this axis.},

	Abstract = {Neurons important for cognitive function are often classified by their morphology and integrative properties. However, it is unclear if within a single class of neuron these properties tune synaptic responses to the salient features of the information that each neuron represents. We demonstrate that for stellate neurons in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex, the waveform of postsynaptic potentials, the time window for detection of coincident inputs, and responsiveness to gamma frequency inputs follow a dorsal-ventral gradient similar to the topographical organization of grid-like spatial firing fields of neurons in this area. We provide evidence that these differences are due to a membrane conductance gradient mediated by HCN and leak potassium channels. These findings suggest key roles for synaptic integration in computations carried out within the medial entorhinal cortex and imply that tuning of neural information processing by membrane ion channels is important for normal cognitive function.},

	Abstract = {In vitro whole cell patch-clamp recordings of stellate cells in layer II of medial entorhinal cortex show a subthreshold membrane potential resonance in response to a sinusoidal current injection of varying frequency. Physiological recordings from awake behaving animals show that neurons in layer II medial entorhinal cortex, termed "grid cells," fire in a spatially selective manner such that each cell's multiple firing fields form a hexagonal grid. Both the spatial periodicity of the grid fields and the resonance frequency change systematically in neurons along the dorsal to ventral axis of medial entorhinal cortex. Previous work has also shown that grid field spacing and acetylcholine levels change as a function of the novelty to a particular environment. Using in vitro whole cell patch-clamp recordings, our study shows that both resonance frequency and resonance strength vary as a function of cholinergic modulation. Furthermore, our data suggest that these changes in resonance properties are mediated through modulation of h-current and m-current.},

We used computer modeling to examine the function of these distal synaptic inputs, which led to three predictions that we confirmed in experiments using rat hippocampal slices. First, activation of CA1 neurons by the perforant path is limited, a result of the long distance between these inputs and the soma. Second, activation of CA1 neurons by the perforant path depends on the generation of dendritic spikes. Third, the forward propagation of these spikes is unreliable, but can be facilitated by modest activation of Schaffer-collateral synapses in the upper apical dendrites. This 'gating' of dendritic spike propagation may be an important activation mode of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and its modulation by neurotransmitters or long-term, activity-dependent plasticity may be an important feature of dendritic integration during mnemonic processing in the hippocampus.},

	Abstract = {CA1 pyramidal cells receive glutamatergic input from the entorhinal cortex through the perforant path (PP) and from CA3 through Schaffer collaterals (SC). The PP input terminates in the stratum lacunosum molecular approximately 300 microm from the cell body, whereas SC synapses have a more proximal location in the stratum radiatum. We compared the properties of AMPA- and NMDA-mediated transmission at these two inputs. The AMPA-mediated components have linear voltage dependence in both inputs. The reversal potential in the PP is only slightly more positive than in the SC, indicating that distal membrane voltage could be effectively set. The NMDA-mediated responses in the two pathways, however, are very different. The PP exhibits inward rectification, as evidenced by very low outward currents. The rectification persists in the absence of extracellular Mg2+. It cannot be attributed to clamping problems, because large outward AMPA currents can be observed even when conditions are modified to have the AMPA currents kinetically match the NMDA currents. Thus, it appears that the PP NMDA channels have novel properties. A second difference between the PP and SC pathways is that the PP has a larger NMDA/AMPA charge ratio. This difference could be observed under many conditions, including block of all voltage-dependent conductances and elimination of the negative resistance of NMDA channels by removing extracellular Mg2+. The difference in ratio thus cannot be attributed to regenerative currents. The higher NMDA component of the distal PP synapses could help to make these synapses more powerful under depolarizing conditions.},

	Abstract = {The rules of synaptic integration in pyramidal cells remain obscure, in part due to conflicting interpretations of existing experimental data. To clarify issues, we developed a CA1 pyramidal cell model calibrated with a broad spectrum of in vitro data. Using simultaneous dendritic and somatic recordings and combining results for two different response measures (peak versus mean EPSP), two different stimulus formats (single shock versus 50 Hz trains), and two different spatial integration conditions (within versus between-branch summation), we found that the cell's subthreshold responses to paired inputs are best described as a sum of nonlinear subunit responses, where the subunits correspond to different dendritic branches. In addition to suggesting a new type of experiment and providing testable predictions, our model shows how conclusions regarding synaptic arithmetic can be influenced by an array of seemingly innocuous experimental design choices.},

	Abstract = {Real-world events unfold at different time scales and, therefore, cognitive and neuronal processes must likewise occur at different time scales. We present a novel procedure that identifies brain regions responsive to sensory information accumulated over different time scales. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging activity while observers viewed silent films presented forward, backward, or piecewise-scrambled in time. Early visual areas (e.g., primary visual cortex and the motion-sensitive area MT+) exhibited high response reliability regardless of disruptions in temporal structure. In contrast, the reliability of responses in several higher brain areas, including the superior temporal sulcus (STS), precuneus, posterior lateral sulcus (LS), temporal parietal junction (TPJ), and frontal eye field (FEF), was affected by information accumulated over longer time scales. These regions showed highly reproducible responses for repeated forward, but not for backward or piecewise-scrambled presentations. Moreover, these regions exhibited marked differences in temporal characteristics, with LS, TPJ, and FEF responses depending on information accumulated over longer durations (approximately 36 s) than STS and precuneus (approximately 12 s). We conclude that, similar to the known cortical hierarchy of spatial receptive fields, there is a hierarchy of progressively longer temporal receptive windows in the human brain.},

	Abstract = {The authors model the neural mechanisms underlying spatial cognition, integrating neuronal systems and behavioral data, and address the relationships between long-term memory, short-term memory, and imagery, and between egocentric and allocentric and visual and ideothetic representations. Long-term spatial memory is modeled as attractor dynamics within medial-temporal allocentric representations, and short-term memory is modeled as egocentric parietal representations driven by perception, retrieval, and imagery and modulated by directed attention. Both encoding and retrieval/imagery require translation between egocentric and allocentric representations, which are mediated by posterior parietal and retrosplenial areas and the use of head direction representations in Papez's circuit. Thus, the hippocampus effectively indexes information by real or imagined location, whereas Papez's circuit translates to imagery or from perception according to the direction of view. Modulation of this translation by motor efference allows spatial updating of representations, whereas prefrontal simulated motor efference allows mental exploration. The alternating temporal-parietal flows of information are organized by the theta rhythm. Simulations demonstrate the retrieval and updating of familiar spatial scenes, hemispatial neglect in memory, and the effects on hippocampal place cell firing of lesioned head direction representations and of conflicting visual and ideothetic inputs.},

	Abstract = {The computational role of the hippocampus in memory has been characterized as: (i) an index to disparate neocortical storage sites; (ii) a time-limited store supporting neocortical long-term memory; and (iii) a content-addressable associative memory. These ideas are reviewed and related to several general aspects of episodic memory, including the differences between episodic, recognition and semantic memory, and whether hippocampal lesions differentially affect recent or remote memories. Some outstanding questions remain, such as: what characterizes episodic retrieval as opposed to other forms of read-out from memory; what triggers the storage of an event memory; and what are the neural mechanisms involved? To address these questions a neural-level model of the medial temporal and parietal roles in retrieval of the spatial context of an event is presented. This model combines the idea that retrieval of the rich context of real-life events is a central characteristic of episodic memory, and the idea that medial temporal allocentric representations are used in long-term storage while parietal egocentric representations are used to imagine, manipulate and re-experience the products of retrieval. The model is consistent with the known neural representation of spatial information in the brain, and provides an explanation for the involvement of Papez's circuit in both the representation of heading direction and in the recollection of episodic information. Two experiments relating to the model are briefly described. A functional neuroimaging study of memory for the spatial context of life-like events in virtual reality provides support for the model's functional localization. A neuropsychological experiment suggests that the hippocampus does store an allocentric representation of spatial locations.},

@article{GillEtal11,
	Abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that hippocampal neurons fire during the delay period in between trials and that these firing patterns differ when different behaviors are required, suggesting that the neuronal responses may be involved in maintaining the memories needed for the upcoming trial. In particular, one study found that hippocampal neurons reliably fired at particular times, referred to as "episode fields" (EFs), during the delay period of a spatial alternation task (Pastalkova et al. (2008) Science 321:1322-1327). The firing of these neurons resulted in distinct sequential firing patterns on left and right turn trials, and these firing patterns could be used to predict the upcoming behavioral response. In this study, we examined neuronal firing during the delay period of a hippocampus-dependent plus maze task, which involved learning to approach two different reward locations (east and west), and we examined the development of these firing patterns with learning. As in the previous study, hippocampal neurons exhibited discrete periods of elevated firing during the delay (EFs) and the firing patterns were distinct on the east and west trials. Moreover, these firing patterns emerged and began to differentiate the east and west conditions during the first training session and continued to develop as the rats learned the task. The finding of similar firing patterns in different tasks suggests that the EFs are a robust phenomenon, which may occur whenever subjects must maintain distinct memory representations during a delay period. Additionally, in the previous study (Pastalkova et al. (2008) Science 321:1322-1327), the distinct firing patterns could have been due to the differing goal locations, behavioral responses (left or right turns), or trajectories. In this study, neuronal firing varied with the goal location regardless of the trajectories or responses, suggesting that the firing patterns encode the behavioral context rather than specific behaviors.},

	Abstract = {Real-life activities, such as watching a movie or engaging in conversation, unfold over many minutes. In the course of such activities, the brain has to integrate information over multiple time scales. We recently proposed that the brain uses similar strategies for integrating information across space and over time. Drawing a parallel with spatial receptive fields, we defined the temporal receptive window (TRW) of a cortical microcircuit as the length of time before a response during which sensory information may affect that response. Our previous findings in the visual system are consistent with the hypothesis that TRWs become larger when moving from low-level sensory to high-level perceptual and cognitive areas. In this study, we mapped TRWs in auditory and language areas by measuring fMRI activity in subjects listening to a real-life story scrambled at the time scales of words, sentences, and paragraphs. Our results revealed a hierarchical topography of TRWs. In early auditory cortices (A1+), brain responses were driven mainly by the momentary incoming input and were similarly reliable across all scrambling conditions. In areas with an intermediate TRW, coherent information at the sentence time scale or longer was necessary to evoke reliable responses. At the apex of the TRW hierarchy, we found parietal and frontal areas that responded reliably only when intact paragraphs were heard in a meaningful sequence. These results suggest that the time scale of processing is a functional property that may provide a general organizing principle for the human cerebral cortex.},

	Abstract = {When a rat moves, grid cells in its entorhinal cortex become active in multiple regions of the external world that form a hexagonal lattice. As the animal traverses one such "firing field," spikes tend to occur at successively earlier theta phases of the local field potential. This phenomenon is called phase precession. Here, we show that spike phases provide 80% more spatial information than spike counts and that they improve position estimates from single neurons down to a few centimeters. To understand what limits the resolution and how variable spike phases are across different field traversals, we analyze spike trains run by run. We find that the multiple firing fields of a grid cell operate as independent elements for encoding physical space. In addition, phase precession is significantly stronger than the pooled-run data suggest. Despite the inherent stochasticity of grid-cell firing, phase precession is therefore a robust phenomenon at the single-trial level, making a theta-phase code for spatial navigation feasible.},

	Abstract = {Object recognition is challenging because each object produces myriad retinal images. Responses of neurons from the inferior temporal cortex (IT) are selective to different objects, yet tolerant ("invariant") to changes in object position, scale, and pose. How does the brain construct this neuronal tolerance? We report a form of neuronal learning that suggests the underlying solution. Targeted alteration of the natural temporal contiguity of visual experience caused specific changes in IT position tolerance. This unsupervised temporal slowness learning (UTL) was substantial, increased with experience, and was significant in single IT neurons after just 1 hour. Together with previous theoretical work and human object perception experiments, we speculate that UTL may reflect the mechanism by which the visual stream builds and maintains tolerant object representations.},

	Abstract = {The midbrain dopamine neurons are hypothesized to provide a physiological correlate of the reward prediction error signal required by current models of reinforcement learning. We examined the activity of single dopamine neurons during a task in which subjects learned by trial and error when to make an eye movement for a juice reward. We found that these neurons encoded the difference between the current reward and a weighted average of previous rewards, a reward prediction error, but only for outcomes that were better than expected. Thus, the firing rate of midbrain dopamine neurons is quantitatively predicted by theoretical descriptions of the reward prediction error signal used in reinforcement learning models for circumstances in which this signal has a positive value. We also found that the dopamine system continued to compute the reward prediction error even when the behavioral policy of the animal was only weakly influenced by this computation.},

	Abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neurons are thought to signal predictions about future rewards based on the memory of past rewarding experience. Little is known about the source of their reward memory and the factors that control its timescale. Here we recorded from dopamine neurons, as well as one of their sources of input, the lateral habenula, while animals predicted upcoming rewards based on the past reward history. We found that lateral habenula and dopamine neurons accessed two distinct reward memories: a short-timescale memory expressed at the start of the task and a near-optimal long-timescale memory expressed when a future reward outcome was revealed. The short- and long-timescale memories were expressed in different forms of reward-oriented eye movements. Our data show that the habenula-dopamine pathway contains multiple timescales of memory and provide evidence for their role in motivated behavior.},

	Abstract = {Animals learn not only about stimuli that predict reward but also about those that signal the omission of an expected reward. We used a conditioned inhibition paradigm derived from animal learning theory to train a discrimination between a visual stimulus that predicted reward (conditioned excitor) and a second stimulus that predicted the omission of reward (conditioned inhibitor). Performing the discrimination required attention to both the conditioned excitor and the inhibitor; however, dopamine neurons showed very different responses to the two classes of stimuli. Conditioned inhibitors elicited considerable depressions in 48 of 69 neurons (median of 35% below baseline) and minor activations in 29 of 69 neurons (69% above baseline), whereas reward-predicting excitors induced pure activations in all 69 neurons tested (242% above baseline), thereby demonstrating that the neurons discriminated between conditioned stimuli predicting reward versus nonreward. The discriminative responses to stimuli with differential reward-predicting but common attentional functions indicate differential neural coding of reward prediction and attention. The neuronal responses appear to reflect reward prediction errors, thus suggesting an extension of the correspondence between learning theory and activity of single dopamine neurons to the prediction of nonreward.},

	Abstract = {Uncertainty is critical in the measure of information and in assessing the accuracy of predictions. It is determined by probability P, being maximal at P = 0.5 and decreasing at higher and lower probabilities. Using distinct stimuli to indicate the probability of reward, we found that the phasic activation of dopamine neurons varied monotonically across the full range of probabilities, supporting past claims that this response codes the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward. In contrast, a previously unobserved response covaried with uncertainty and consisted of a gradual increase in activity until the potential time of reward. The coding of uncertainty suggests a possible role for dopamine signals in attention-based learning and risk-taking behavior.},

In 3 experiments, variability on both the production and perception tasks was found to be linearly related to the square of the target intervals. If the perception and production of short temporal intervals use a common timing mechanism, the slopes of the functions for the 2 tasks should be identical. The results of Experiment 1 failed to support this prediction. However, when the 2 tasks were made more similar by providing a single (Experiment 2) or multiple (Experiment 3) presentations of the target interval per judgment or production, the perception and production functions were nearly identical. The results suggest that temporal judgments and productions are based on an integrated internal representation of the target interval rather than reference to an internal oscillatory process.},

	Abstract = {The remarkable successes of the physical sciences have been built on highly general quantitative laws, which serve as the basis for understanding an enormous variety of specific physical systems. How far is it possible to construct universal principles in the cognitive sciences, in terms of which specific aspects of perception, memory, or decision making might be modelled? Following Shepard (e.g., 1987), it is argued that some universal principles may be attainable in cognitive science. Here, 2 examples are proposed: the simplicity principle (which states that the cognitive system prefers patterns that provide simpler explanations of available data); and the scale-invariance principle, which states that many cognitive phenomena are independent of the scale of relevant underlying physical variables, such as time, space, luminance, or sound pressure. This article illustrates how principles may be combined to explain specific cognitive processes by using these principles to derive SIMPLE, a formal model of memory for serial order (Brown, Neath, & Chater, 2007), and briefly mentions some extensions to models of identification and categorization. This article also considers the scope and limitations of universal laws in cognitive science.},

	Abstract = {Episodic memory involves remembering the incidental order of a series of events that comprise a specific experience. Current models of temporal organization in episodic memory have demonstrated that animals can make memory judgments about the order of serially presented events; however, in these protocols, the animals can judge items based on their relative recency. Thus, it remains unclear as to whether animals use the specific order of items in forming memories of distinct sequences. To resolve this important issue in memory representation, we presented mice repeatedly with two widely separated odor sequences and then tested their natural exploratory preference between pairs of odors selected from within or between sequences. Intact animals preferred to investigate odors that occurred earlier within each sequence, indicating they did remember the order of events within each distinct sequence. In contrast, intact animals did not discriminate between pairs of odors from different sequences. These findings indicate that preferences were not guided by relative recency, which would be expected to support graded discrimination between widely separated events. Furthermore, damage to either the hippocampus or the medial prefrontal cortex eliminated order preference within sequences. Despite the deficit in order memory, control recognition tests showed that normal mice and mice with hippocampal or medial prefrontal damage could correctly identify previously experienced odors compared with novel odors. These findings provide strong evidence that animals form representations of the order of events within specific experiences and that the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are essential to order memory.},

	Abstract = {We show that simple assumptions about neural processing lead to a model of interval timing as a temporal integration process, in which a noisy firing-rate representation of time rises linearly on average toward a response threshold over the course of an interval. Our assumptions include: that neural spike trains are approximately independent Poisson processes, that correlations among them can be largely cancelled by balancing excitation and inhibition, that neural populations can act as integrators, and that the objective of timed behavior is maximal accuracy and minimal variance. The model accounts for a variety of physiological and behavioral findings in rodents, monkeys, and humans, including ramping firing rates between the onset of reward-predicting cues and the receipt of delayed rewards, and universally scale-invariant response time distributions in interval timing tasks. It furthermore makes specific, well-supported predictions about the skewness of these distributions, a feature of timing data that is usually ignored. The model also incorporates a rapid (potentially one-shot) duration-learning procedure. Human behavioral data support the learning rule's predictions regarding learning speed in sequences of timed responses. These results suggest that simple, integration-based models should play as prominent a role in interval timing theory as they do in theories of perceptual decision making, and that a common neural mechanism may underlie both types of behavior.},

	Abstract = {Humans and other animals demonstrate the ability to perceive and respond to temporally relevant information with characteristic behavioral properties. For example, the response time distributions in peak-interval timing tasks are well described by Gaussian functions, and superimpose when scaled by the criterion duration. This superimposition has been referred to as the scalar property and results from the fact that the standard deviation of a temporal estimate is proportional to the duration being timed. Various psychological models have been proposed to account for such responding. These models vary in their success in predicting the temporal control of behavior as well as in the neurobiological feasibility of the mechanisms they postulate. A review of the major interval timing models reveals that no current model is successful on both counts. The neurobiological properties of the basal ganglia, an area known to be necessary for interval timing and motor control, suggests that this set of structures act as a coincidence detector of cortical and thalamic input. The hypothesized functioning of the basal ganglia is similar to the mechanisms proposed in the beat frequency timing model [R.C. Miall, Neural Computation 1 (1989) 359-371], leading to a reevaluation of its capabilities in terms of behavioral prediction. By implementing a probabilistic firing rule, a dynamic response threshold, and adding variance to a number of its components, simulations of the striatal beat frequency model were able to produce output that is functionally equivalent to the expected behavioral response form of peak-interval timing procedures.},

@article{StadHiga99,
	Abstract = {A popular view of interval timing in animals is that it is driven by a discrete pacemaker-accumulator mechanism that yields a linear scale for encoded time. But these mechanisms are fundamentally at odds with the Weber law property of interval timing, and experiments that support linear encoded time can be interpreted in other ways. We argue that the dominant pacemaker-accumulator theory, scalar expectancy theory (SET), fails to explain some basic properties of operant behavior on interval-timing procedures and can only accommodate a number of discrepancies by modifications and elaborations that raise questions about the entire theory. We propose an alternative that is based on principles of memory dynamics derived from the multiple-time-scale (MTS) model of habituation. The MTS timing model can account for data from a wide variety of time-related experiments: proportional and Weber law temporal discrimination, transient as well as persistent effects of reinforcement omission and reinforcement magnitude, bisection, the discrimination of relative as well as absolute duration, and the choose-short effect and its analogue in number-discrimination experiments. Resemblances between timing and counting are an automatic consequence of the model. We also argue that the transient and persistent effects of drugs on time estimates can be interpreted as well within MTS theory as in SET. Recent real-time physiological data conform in surprising detail to the assumptions of the MTS habituation model. Comparisons between the two views suggest a number of novel experiments.},

	Abstract = {When monkeys perform a delayed match-to-sample task, some neurons in the anterior inferotemporal cortex show sustained activity following the presentation of specific visual stimuli, typically only those that are shown repeatedly. When sample stimuli are shown in a fixed temporal order, the few images that evoke delay activity in a given neuron are often neighboring stimuli in the sequence, suggesting that this delay activity may be the neural correlate of associative long-term memory. Here we report that stimulus-selective sustained activity is also evident following the presentation of the test stimulus in the same task. We use a neural network model to demonstrate that persistent stimulus-selective activity across the intertrial interval can lead to similar mnemonic representations (distributions of delay activity across the neural population) for neighboring visual stimuli. Thus, inferotemporal cortex may contain neural machinery for generating long-term stimulus--stimulus associations.},

A sequence of 5 odors mixed in sand was presented in digging cups, 1 at a time, to each rat in a sequence that varied on each trial. A reward was buried in each cup. After the 5th odor, 2 of the previous 5 odors were presented simultaneously; to receive a reward, the rat had to choose the odor that occurred earliest in the sequence. Temporal separations of 1, 2, or 3 represented the number of odors that occurred between the 2 odors in the sequence. Once a preoperative criterion was reached, each rat received a hippocampal (HIP) or cortical control lesion and was retested on the task. On postoperative trials, the HIP group was impaired relative to controls. However, the HIP group could discriminate between the odors. The data suggest that the hippocampus is involved in separating sensory events in time so that I event can be remembered separately from another event.},

	Abstract = {The present study investigated the roles of the perirhinal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and intrahemispheric interactions between them in recognition and temporal order memory for objects. Experiment 1 assessed the effects of bilateral microinfusions of the sodium channel blocker lidocaine into either the anterior perirhinal or medial prefrontal cortex immediately before memory testing in a familiarity discrimination task and a recency discrimination task, both of which involved spontaneous exploration of objects. Inactivation of the perirhinal cortex disrupted performance in both tasks, whereas inactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex disrupted performance in the recency, but not the familiarity, discrimination task. In a second experiment, the importance of intrahemispheric interactions between these structures in temporal order memory were assessed by comparing the effects of unilateral inactivation of either structure alone with those of crossed unilateral inactivation of both structures on the recency discrimination task. Crossed unilateral inactivation of both structures produced a significant impairment, whereas inactivation of either structure alone produced little or no impairment. Collectively, these findings suggest that the perirhinal cortex, but not the medial prefrontal cortex, contributes to retrieval of information necessary for long-term object recognition, whereas both structures, via intrahemispheric interactions between them, contribute to retrieval of information necessary for long-term object temporal order memory. These data are consistent with models in which attributed information is stored in posterior cortical sites and supports lower-order mnemonic functions (e.g., recognition memory) but can also be retrieved and further processed via interactions with the prefrontal cortex to support higher-order mnemonic functions (e.g., temporal order memory).},

	Abstract = {The prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in recollecting the temporal context of past events. The present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and explored the neural correlates of temporal-order retrieval during a recency judgment paradigm. In this paradigm, after study of a list of words presented sequentially, subjects were presented with two of the studied words simultaneously and were asked which of the two words was studied more recently. Two types of such retrieval trials with varied (high and low) levels of demand for temporal-order retrieval were intermixed and compared using event-related fMRI. The intraparadigm comparison of high versus low demand trials revealed brain regions with activation that was modulated on the basis of demand for temporal-order retrieval. Multiple lateral prefrontal regions including the middle and inferior lateral prefrontal cortex were prominently activated. Activation was also observed in the anterior prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal cortex, regions well documented to be related to memory retrieval in general. The modulation of brain activity in these regions suggests a detailed pathway that is engaged during recency judgment.},

	Abstract = {According to classical concepts of physiologic control, healthy systems are self-regulated to reduce variability and maintain physiologic constancy. Contrary to the predictions of homeostasis, however, the output of a wide variety of systems, such as the normal human heartbeat, fluctuates in a complex manner, even under resting conditions. Scaling techniques adapted from statistical physics reveal the presence of long-range, power-law correlations, as part of multifractal cascades operating over a wide range of time scales. These scaling properties suggest that the nonlinear regulatory systems are operating far from equilibrium, and that maintaining constancy is not the goal of physiologic control. In contrast, for subjects at high risk of sudden death (including those with heart failure), fractal organization, along with certain nonlinear interactions, breaks down. Application of fractal analysis may provide new approaches to assessing cardiac risk and forecasting sudden cardiac death, as well as to monitoring the aging process. Similar approaches show promise in assessing other regulatory systems, such as human gait control in health and disease. Elucidating the fractal and nonlinear mechanisms involved in physiologic control and complex signaling networks is emerging as a major challenge in the postgenomic era.},

	Abstract = {Small-world properties have been demonstrated for many complex networks. Here, we applied the discrete wavelet transform to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series, acquired from healthy volunteers in the resting state, to estimate frequency-dependent correlation matrices characterizing functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions. After thresholding the wavelet correlation matrices to create undirected graphs of brain functional networks, we found a small-world topology of sparse connections most salient in the low-frequency interval 0.03-0.06 Hz. Global mean path length (2.49) was approximately equivalent to a comparable random network, whereas clustering (0.53) was two times greater; similar parameters have been reported for the network of anatomical connections in the macaque cortex. The human functional network was dominated by a neocortical core of highly connected hubs and had an exponentially truncated power law degree distribution. Hubs included recently evolved regions of the heteromodal association cortex, with long-distance connections to other regions, and more cliquishly connected regions of the unimodal association and primary cortices; paralimbic and limbic regions were topologically more peripheral. The network was more resilient to targeted attack on its hubs than a comparable scale-free network, but about equally resilient to random error. We conclude that correlated, low-frequency oscillations in human fMRI data have a small-world architecture that probably reflects underlying anatomical connectivity of the cortex. Because the major hubs of this network are critical for cognition, its slow dynamics could provide a physiological substrate for segregated and distributed information processing.},

	Abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of the human brain have suggested that low-frequency fluctuations in resting fMRI data collected using blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) contrast correspond to functionally relevant resting state networks (RSNs). Whether the fluctuations of resting fMRI signal in RSNs are a direct consequence of neocortical neuronal activity or are low-frequency artifacts due to other physiological processes (e.g., autonomically driven fluctuations in cerebral blood flow) is uncertain. In order to investigate further these fluctuations, we have characterized their spatial and temporal properties using probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA), a robust approach to RSN identification. Here, we provide evidence that: i. RSNs are not caused by signal artifacts due to low sampling rate (aliasing); ii. they are localized primarily to the cerebral cortex; iii. similar RSNs also can be identified in perfusion fMRI data; and iv. at least 5 distinct RSN patterns are reproducible across different subjects. The RSNs appear to reflect "default" interactions related to functional networks related to those recruited by specific types of cognitive processes. RSNs are a major source of non-modeled signal in BOLD fMRI data, so a full understanding of their dynamics will improve the interpretation of functional brain imaging studies more generally. Because RSNs reflect interactions in cognitively relevant functional networks, they offer a new approach to the characterization of state changes with pathology and the effects of drugs.},

	Abstract = {Functional neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies have documented a dynamic baseline of intrinsic (not stimulus- or task-evoked) brain activity during resting wakefulness. This baseline is characterized by slow (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations of functional imaging signals that are topographically organized in discrete brain networks, and by much faster (1-80 Hz) electrical oscillations. To investigate the relationship between hemodynamic and electrical oscillations, we have adopted a completely data-driven approach that combines information from simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using independent component analysis on the fMRI data, we identified six widely distributed resting state networks. The blood oxygenation level-dependent signal fluctuations associated with each network were correlated with the EEG power variations of delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma rhythms. Each functional network was characterized by a specific electrophysiological signature that involved the combination of different brain rhythms. Moreover, the joint EEG/fMRI analysis afforded a finer physiological fractionation of brain networks in the resting human brain. This result supports for the first time in humans the coalescence of several brain rhythms within large-scale brain networks as suggested by biophysical studies.},

	Abstract = {Long-counting-time pulse-number distributions (PND's) were measured from a broad variety of cat primary auditory fibers using different tone and noise stimuli, counting times T, and number of samples NT. Whereas short-counting-time PND's (T approximately 50 ms) manifest the presence of spike pairs (an enhancement of even over odd-count probabilities), the irregular shapes of the long-counting-time PND's (T approximately greater than 0.1 s) reveal that the underlying sequence of action potentials consists of spike clusters when viewed on a longer time scale. For all units measured, the count variance-to-mean ratio (Fano factor) F(T) varied little over some 90 dB change in the stimulus level. On the other hand, F(T) increased substantially as T and/or NT were increased, corresponding to the capture of larger and larger spike clusters in the counting time. A relationship is developed between the Fano-time function F(T) and the normalized coincidence rate function, g(tau) versus delay time tau. A plausible form for g(tau) leads to a Fano-time function in good accord with the data. The observed power-law growth of the Fano factor for large counting times [F(T) approximately T alpha where 0 less than alpha less than 1] is accompanied by a power-law decay of the coincidence rate for large delay times [g(tau) approximately tau alpha -1] and a power-law form for the power spectral density at low frequencies [S(f) approximately f -alpha]. The behavior of the PND's and the scale invariance implicit in these fractional-power-law relationships suggest that the neural events on all primary auditory fibers exhibit fractal behavior for sufficiently large times (sufficiently low frequencies). The spike pairs and spike clusters in the PND's are natural consequences of this behavior. The fractal dimension D identical to alpha is estimated to be in the range of 0.3 approximately less than D approximately less than 0.9 for counting times in the range 0.1-10 s. The fractal dimension provides a measure of the degree of event clustering, or irregularity of a sequence of events, that is preserved over different time scales. PND's from low-skew vestibular units, in contrast, do not exhibit fractal behavior. It is suggested that auditory neural-firing patterns may serve to efficiently sample natural fractal noises.},

	Abstract = {The primary visual cortex (V1) is the first cortical area to receive visual input, and inferior temporal (IT) areas are among the last along the ventral visual pathway. We recorded, in area V1 of anaesthetized cats and area IT of awake macaque monkeys, responses of neurons to videos of natural scenes. Responses were analysed to test various hypotheses concerning the nature of neural coding in these two regions. A variety of spike-train statistics were measured including spike-count distributions, interspike interval distributions, coefficients of variation, power spectra, Fano factors and different sparseness measures. All statistics showed non-Poisson characteristics and several revealed self-similarity of the spike trains. Spike-count distributions were approximately exponential in both visual areas for eight different videos and for counting windows ranging from 50 ms to 5 seconds. The results suggest that the neurons maximize their information carrying capacity while maintaining a fixed long-term-average firing rate, or equivalently, minimize their average firing rate for a fixed information carrying capacity.},

	Abstract = {We used a variety of statistical measures to identify the point process that describes the maintained discharge of retinal ganglion cells (RGC's) and neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the cat. These measures are based on both interevent intervals and event counts and include the interevent-interval histogram, rescaled range analysis, the event-number histogram, the Fano factor, Allan factor, and the periodogram. In addition, we applied these measures to surrogate versions of the data, generated by random shuffling of the order of interevent intervals. The continuing statistics reveal 1/f-type fluctuations in the data (long-duration power-law correlation), which are not present in the shuffled data. Estimates of the fractal exponents measured for RGC- and their target LGN-spike trains are similar in value, indicating that the fractal behavior either is transmitted form one cell to the other or has a common origin. The gamma-r renewal process model, often used in the analysis of visual-neuron interevent intervals, describes certain short-term features of the RGC and LGN data reasonably well but fails to account for the long-duration correlation. We present a new model for visual-system nerve-spike firings: a gamma-r renewal process whose mean is modulated by fractal binomial noise. This fractal, doubly stochastic point process characterizes the statistical behavior of both RGC and LGN data sets remarkably well.},

	Abstract = {The spontaneous or background discharge patterns of in vivo single neuron is mostly considered as neuronal noise, which is assumed to be devoid of any correlation between successive inter-spike-intervals (ISI). Such random fluctuations are modeled only statistically by stochastic point process, lacking any temporal correlation. In this study, we have investigated the nature of spontaneous irregular fluctuations of single neurons from human hippocampus-amygdala complex by three different methods: (i) detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), (ii) multiscale entropy (MSE), (iii) rate estimate convergence. Both the DFA and MSE analysis showed the presence of long-range power-law correlation over time in the ISI sequences. Moreover, we observed that the individual spike trains presented non-random structure on longer time-scales and showed slow convergence of rate estimates with increasing counting time. This power-law correlation and the slow convergence of statistical moments were eliminated by randomly shuffling the ISIs even though the distributions of ISIs were preserved. Thus the power-law relationship arose from long-term correlations among ISIs that were destroyed by shuffling the data. Further, we found that neurons which showed long-range correlations also showed statistically significant correlated firing as measured by correlation coefficient or mutual information function. The presence of long-range correlations indicates the history-effect or memory in the firing pattern by the associative formation of a neuronal assembly.},

In Experiment 1, participants were presented with lists of eight words, were precued or postcued to respond using free recall or ISR, and rehearsed out loud during presentation. The patterns of rehearsal were similar in all the conditions, and there was little difference between recall in the precued and postcued conditions. In Experiment 2, both free recall and ISR were sensitive to word length and presentation rate and showed similar patterns of rehearsal. In Experiment 3, both tasks were sensitive to word length and articulatory suppression. The word length effects generalized to 6-item (Experiment 4) and 12-item (Experiment 5) lists. These findings suggest that the two tasks are underpinned by highly similar rehearsal and recall processes.},

	Abstract = {In 4 experiments, participants were presented with lists of between 1 and 15 words for tests of immediate memory. For all tasks, participants tended to initiate recall with the first word on the list for short lists. As the list length was increased, so there was a decreased tendency to start with the first list item; and, when free to do so, participants showed an increased tendency to start with one of the last 4 list items. In all tasks, the start position strongly influenced the shape of the resultant serial position curves: When recall started at Serial Position 1, elevated recall of early list items was observed; when recall started toward the end of the list, there were extended recency effects. These results occurred under immediate free recall (IFR) and different variants of immediate serial recall (ISR) and reconstruction of order (RoO) tasks. We argue that these findings have implications for the relationship between IFR and ISR and between rehearsal and recall.},

By turning positional information from a reliable cue into a source of intertrial interference, we expected learning to be greatly impaired. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that participants were only slightly worse at serial learning under spin conditions and that this impairment reflects a substantial increase in initiation errors coupled with a small increase in intertrial forgetting. These data show that participants can effectively use nonpositional cues when positional cues are unreliable.},

	Abstract = {The well-known finding that responses in serial recall tend to be clustered around the position of the target item has bolstered positional-coding theories of serial order memory. In the present study, we show that this effect is confounded with another well-known finding--that responses in serial recall tend to also be clustered around the position of the prior recall (temporal clustering). The confound can be alleviated by conditioning each analysis on the positional accuracy of the previously recalled item. The revised analyses show that temporal clustering is much more prevalent in serial recall than is positional clustering. A simple associative chaining model with asymmetric neighboring, remote associations, and a primacy gradient can account for these effects. Using the same parameter values, the model produces reasonable serial position curves and captures the changes in item and order information across study-test trials. In contrast, a prominent positional coding model cannot account for the pattern of clustering uncovered by the new analyses.},

	Abstract = {A classic law of cognition is that forgetting curves are closely approximated by power functions. This law describes relations between different empirical dependent variables and the retention interval, and the precise form of the functional relation depends on the scale used to measure each variable. In the research reported here, we conducted a recognition task involving both short- and long-term probes. We discovered that formal memory-strength parameters from an exemplar-recognition model closely followed a power function of the lag between studied items and a test probe. The model accounted for rich sets of response time (RT) data at both individual-subject and individual-lag levels. Because memory strengths were derived from model fits to choices and RTs from individual trials, the psychological power law was independent of the scale used to summarize the forgetting functions. Alternative models that assumed different functional relations or posited a separate fixed-strength working memory store fared considerably worse than the power-law model did in predicting the data.},

In addition, the pattern of sequential dependencies observed in recognition differs from that observed for many perception tasks. This suggests that sequential dependencies arise from mnemonic or perceptual processes and not from decision processes that should be common to memory and perception tasks.

	Abstract = {Measures of retrieval speed indicated that only a small subset of representations in working memory falls within the focus of attention. An n-back task, which required tracking an item 1, 2, or 3 back in a sequentially presented list, was used to examine the representation and retrieval of recent events and how control processes can be used to maintain an item in focal attention while concurrently processing new information. A speed-accuracy trade-off procedure was used to derive measures of the availability and the speed with which recent events can be accessed. Results converge with other time course studies in demonstrating that attention can be concurrently allocated only to a small number of memory representations, perhaps just 1 item. Measures of retrieval speed further demonstrate that order information is retrieved by a slow search process when an item is not maintained within focal attention.},

	Abstract = {Memory enables flexible use of past experience to inform new behaviors. Though leading theories hypothesize that this fundamental flexibility results from the formation of integrated memory networks relating multiple experiences, the neural mechanisms that support memory integration are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that retrieval-mediated learning, whereby prior event details are reinstated during encoding of related experiences, supports participants' ability to infer relationships between distinct events that share content. Furthermore, we show that activation changes in a functionally coupled hippocampal and ventral medial prefrontal cortical circuit track the formation of integrated memories and successful inferential memory performance. These findings characterize the respective roles of these regions in retrieval-mediated learning processes that support relational memory network formation and inferential memory in the human brain. More broadly, these data reveal fundamental mechanisms through which memory representations are constructed into prospectively useful formats.
HIGHLIGHTS
* Shared content across experiences triggers reactivation of overlapping memories
* Anterior medial temporal lobe cortex tracks fidelity of retrieval during encoding
* Hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex interact to integrate related events
* Retrieval-mediated memory integration enables inference across experiences},

	Abstract = {A key question in the analysis of hippocampal memory relates to how attention modulates the encoding and long-term retrieval of spatial and nonspatial representations in this region. To address this question, we recorded from single cells over a period of 5 days in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus while mice acquired one of two goal-oriented tasks. These tasks required the animals to find a hidden food reward by attending to either the visuospatial environment or a particular odor presented in shifting spatial locations. Attention to the visuospatial environment increased the stability of visuospatial representations and phase locking to gamma oscillations--a form of neuronal synchronization thought to underlie the attentional mechanism necessary for processing task-relevant information. Attention to a spatially shifting olfactory cue compromised the stability of place fields and increased the stability of reward-associated odor representations, which were most consistently retrieved during periods of sniffing and digging when animals were restricted to the cup locations. Together, these results suggest that attention selectively modulates the encoding and retrieval of hippocampal representations by enhancing physiological responses to task-relevant information.},

	Abstract = {Learning to classify diverse experiences into meaningful groups, like categories, is fundamental to normal cognition. To understand its neural basis, we simultaneously recorded from multiple electrodes in lateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum, two interconnected brain structures critical for learning. Each day, monkeys learned to associate novel abstract, dot-based categories with a right versus left saccade. Early on, when they could acquire specific stimulus-response associations, striatum activity was an earlier predictor of the corresponding saccade. However, as the number of exemplars increased and monkeys had to learn to classify them, PFC activity began to predict the saccade associated with each category before the striatum. While monkeys were categorizing novel exemplars at a high rate, PFC activity was a strong predictor of their corresponding saccade early in the trial before the striatal neurons. These results suggest that striatum plays a greater role in stimulus-response association and PFC in abstraction of categories.},

	Abstract = {The prefrontal (PF) cortex has been implicated in the remarkable ability of primates to form and rearrange arbitrary associations rapidly. This ability was studied in two monkeys, using a task that required them to learn to make specific saccades in response to particular cues and then repeatedly reverse these responses. We found that the activity of individual PF neurons represented both the cues and the associated responses, perhaps providing a neural substrate for their association. Furthermore, during learning, neural activity conveyed the direction of the animals' impending responses progressively earlier within each successive trial. The final level of activity just before the response, however, was unaffected by learning. These results suggest a role for the PF cortex in learning arbitrary cue-response associations, an ability critical for complex behavior.},

	Abstract = {Oscillations and synchrony in basal ganglia circuits may play a key role in the organization of voluntary actions and habits. We recorded single units and local field potentials from multiple striatal and cortical locations simultaneously, over a range of behavioral states. We observed opposite gradients of oscillatory entrainment, with dorsal/lateral striatal neurons entrained to high-voltage spindle oscillations ("spike wave discharges") and ventral/medial striatal neurons entrained to the hippocampal theta rhythm. While the majority of units were likely medium-spiny projection neurons, a second neuronal population showed characteristic features of fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons, including tonic activity, brief waveforms, and high-frequency bursts. These fired at an earlier spindle phase than the main neuronal population, and their density within striatum corresponded closely to the intensity of spindle oscillations. The orchestration of oscillatory activity by networks of striatal interneurons may be an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease.},

	Abstract = {A number of studies have examined the perception of time with durations ranging from milliseconds to a few seconds, however the neural basis of these processes are still poorly understood and the neural substrates underlying the perception of multiple-second intervals are unknown. Here we present evidence of neural systems activity in circumscribed areas of the human brain involved in the encoding of intervals with durations of 9 and 18s in a temporal reproduction task using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During the encoding there was greater activation in more posterior parts of the medial frontal and insular cortex whereas the reproduction phase involved more anterior parts of these brain structures. Intriguingly, activation curves over time show an accumulating pattern of neural activity, which peaks at the end of the interval within bilateral posterior insula and superior temporal cortex when individuals are presented with 9- and 18-s tone intervals. This is consistent with an accumulator-type activity, which encodes duration in the multiple seconds range. Given the close connection between the dorsal posterior insula and ascending internal body signals, we suggest that the accumulation of physiological changes in body states constitutes our experience of time. This is the first time that an accumulation function in the posterior insula is detected that might be correlated with the encoding of time intervals.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in monkey orbitofrontal cortex (OF) are known to respond to reward-predicting cues with a strength that depends on the value of the predicted reward as determined 1) by intrinsic attributes including size and quality and 2) by extrinsic factors including the monkey's state of satiation and awareness of what other rewards are currently available. We pose here the question whether another extrinsic factor critical to determining reward value-the delay expected to elapse before delivery-influences neuronal activity in OF. To answer this question, we recorded from OF neurons while monkeys performed a memory-guided saccade task in which a cue presented early in each trial predicted whether the delay before the monkey could respond and receive a reward of fixed size would be short or long. OF neurons tended to fire more strongly in response to a cue predicting a short delay. The tendency to fire more strongly in anticipation of a short delay was correlated across neurons with the tendency to fire more strongly before a large reward. We conclude that neuronal activity in OF represents the time-discounted value of the expected reward.},

	Abstract = {Several areas of the brain are known to participate in temporal processing. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are thought to contribute to perception of time intervals. However, it remains unclear whether the PFC itself can generate time intervals independently of external stimuli. Here we describe a group of PFC neurons in area 9 that became active when monkeys recognized a particular elapsed time within the range of 1-7 seconds. Another group of area 9 neurons became active only when subjects reproduced a specific interval without external cues. Both types of neurons were individually tuned to recognize or reproduce particular intervals. Moreover, the injection of muscimol, a GABA agonist, into this area bilaterally resulted in an increase in the error rate during time interval reproduction. These results suggest that area 9 may process multi-second intervals not only in perceptual recognition, but also in internal generation of time intervals.},

	Abstract = {Nearly every memory retrieval episode ends with a decision to terminate memory search. Yet, no research has investigated whether these search termination decisions are systematic, let alone whether they are made consistent with a particular rule. In the present paper, we used a modified free-recall paradigm to examine the decision to terminate search. Data from two experiments revealed that the total time engaged in retrieval was a monotonically increasing function of the total number of items retrieved, whereas the time from final retrieval to search termination (exit latency) was a monotonically decreasing function of the total number of items retrieved. These findings were compared to the predictions of previously proposed stopping rules, using the Search of Associative Memory framework. Of the four rules examined, only one predicts the obtained data pattern.},

In this study, the authors investigated termination decisions in free recall by providing participants an open-ended retrieval interval and requiring them to press a stop button when they had finished retrieving. Three variables important to assessing one's willingness to search memory were examined: (a) the time spent searching memory after the last successful retrieval before choosing to quit (the exit latency); (b) task difficulty; and (c) individual differences in motivation, as measured by Webster and Kruglanski's (1994) Need for Closure Scale. A strong negative correlation was found between individual differences in motivation and participants' exit latencies. This negative correlation was present only when the retrieval task started out as relatively difficult.},

	Abstract = {Theta phase-locking and phase precession are two related phenomena reflecting coordination of hippocampal place cell firing with the local, ongoing theta rhythm. The mechanisms and functions of both the phenomena remain unclear, though the robust correlation between firing phase and location of the animal has lead to the suggestion that this phase relationship constitutes a temporal code for spatial information. Recent work has described theta phase-locking in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a structure with direct anatomical and functional links to the hippocampus. Here, we describe an initial characterization of phase precession in the mPFC relative to the CA1 theta rhythm. mPFC phase precession was most robust during behavioral epochs known to be associated with enhanced theta-frequency coordination of CA1 and mPFC activities. Precession was coherent across the mPFC population, with multiple neurons precessing in parallel as a function of location of the animal. The existence of phase precession beyond the hippocampus implies a more global role for this phenomenon during theta rhythm-mediated coordination of neural activity.},

	Abstract = {To study the interplay between hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (Pfc) and its importance for learning and memory consolidation, we measured the coherence in theta oscillations between these two structures in rats learning new rules on a Y maze. Coherence peaked at the choice point, most strongly after task rule acquisition. Simultaneously, Pfc pyramidal neurons reorganized their phase, concentrating at hippocampal theta trough, and synchronous cell assemblies emerged. This synchronous state may result from increased inhibition exerted by interneurons on pyramidal cells, as measured by cross-correlation, and could be modulated by dopamine: we found similar hippocampal-Pfc theta coherence increases and neuronal phase shifts following local administration of dopamine in Pfc of anesthetized rats. Pfc cell assemblies emerging during high coherence were preferentially replayed during subsequent sleep, concurrent with hippocampal sharp waves. Thus, hippocampal/prefrontal coherence could lead to synchronization of reward predicting activity in prefrontal networks, tagging it for subsequent memory consolidation.},

	Abstract = {Decision-making requires the coordinated activity of diverse brain structures. For example, in maze-based tasks, the prefrontal cortex must integrate spatial information encoded in the hippocampus with mnemonic information concerning route and task rules in order to direct behavior appropriately. Using simultaneous tetrode recordings from CA1 of the rat hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex, we show that correlated firing in the two structures is selectively enhanced during behavior that recruits spatial working memory, allowing the integration of hippocampal spatial information into a broader, decision-making network. The increased correlations are paralleled by enhanced coupling of the two structures in the 4- to 12-Hz theta-frequency range. Thus the coordination of theta rhythms may constitute a general mechanism through which the relative timing of disparate neural activities can be controlled, allowing specialized brain structures to both encode information independently and to interact selectively according to current behavioral demands.},

During learning, neural responses to reward in these neurons waned and responses to cues that predicted reward emerged. Notably, this cue-evoked activity varied with size and delay.

	Abstract = {We monitored single-neuron activity in the orbitofrontal cortex of rats performing a time-discounting task in which the spatial location of the reward predicted whether the delay preceding reward delivery would be short or long. We found that rewards delivered after a short delay elicited a stronger neuronal response than those delivered after a long delay in most neurons. Activity in these neurons was not influenced by reward size when delays were held constant. This was also true for a minority of neurons that exhibited sustained increases in firing in anticipation of delayed reward. Thus, encoding of time-discounted rewards in orbitofrontal cortex is independent of the encoding of absolute reward value. These results are contrary to the proposal that orbitofrontal neurons signal the value of delayed rewards in a common currency and instead suggest alternative proposals for the role this region plays in guiding responses for delayed versus immediate rewards.},

	Abstract = {Humans and other animals must often make decisions on the basis of imperfect evidence. Statisticians use measures such as P values to assign degrees of confidence to propositions, but little is known about how the brain computes confidence estimates about decisions. We explored this issue using behavioural analysis and neural recordings in rats in combination with computational modelling. Subjects were trained to perform an odour categorization task that allowed decision confidence to be manipulated by varying the distance of the test stimulus to the category boundary. To understand how confidence could be computed along with the choice itself, using standard models of decision-making, we defined a simple measure that quantified the quality of the evidence contributing to a particular decision. Here we show that the firing rates of many single neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex match closely to the predictions of confidence models and cannot be readily explained by alternative mechanisms, such as learning stimulus-outcome associations. Moreover, when tested using a delayed reward version of the task, we found that rats' willingness to wait for rewards increased with confidence, as predicted by the theoretical model. These results indicate that confidence estimates, previously suggested to require 'metacognition' and conscious awareness are available even in the rodent brain, can be computed with relatively simple operations, and can drive adaptive behaviour. We suggest that confidence estimation may be a fundamental and ubiquitous component of decision-making.},

	Abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is important in processing rewards and other behavioral outcomes. Here, we review from a computational perspective recent progress in understanding this complex function. OFC neurons appear to represent abstract outcome values, which may facilitate the comparison of options, as well as concrete outcome attributes, such as flavor or location, which may enable predictive cues to access current outcome values in the face of dynamic modulation by internal state, context and learning. OFC can use reinforcement learning to generate outcome predictions; it can also generate outcome predictions using other mechanisms, including the evaluation of decision confidence or uncertainty. OFC neurons encode not only the mean expected outcome but also the variance, consistent with the idea that OFC uses a probabilistic population code to represent outcomes. We suggest that further attention to the nature of its representations and algorithms will be critical to further elucidating OFC function.},

	Abstract = {To navigate our complex world, our brains have evolved a sophisticated ability to quickly learn arbitrary rules such as 'stop at red'. Studies in monkeys using a laboratory test of this capacity--conditional association learning--have revealed that frontal lobe structures (including the prefrontal cortex) as well as subcortical nuclei of the basal ganglia are involved in such learning. Neural correlates of associative learning have been observed in both brain regions, but whether or not these regions have unique functions is unclear, as they have typically been studied separately using different tasks. Here we show that during associative learning in monkeys, neural activity in these areas changes at different rates: the striatum (an input structure of the basal ganglia) showed rapid, almost bistable, changes compared with a slower trend in the prefrontal cortex that was more in accordance with slow improvements in behavioural performance. Also, pre-saccadic activity began progressively earlier in the striatum but not in the prefrontal cortex as learning took place. These results support the hypothesis that rewarded associations are first identified by the basal ganglia, the output of which 'trains' slower learning mechanisms in the frontal cortex.},

	Abstract = {The orbital part of prefrontal cortex appears to be crucially involved in the motivational control of goal-directed behaviour. Patients with lesions of orbitofrontal cortex show impairments in making decisions about the expected outcome of actions. Monkeys with orbitofrontal lesions respond abnormally to changes in reward expectations and show altered reward preferences. As rewards constitute basic goals of behaviour, we investigated here how neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex of monkeys process information about liquid and food rewards in a typical frontal task, spatial delayed responding. The activity of orbitofrontal neurons increases in response to reward-predicting signals, during the expectation of rewards, and after the receipt of rewards. Neurons discriminate between different rewards, mainly irrespective of the spatial and visual features of reward-predicting stimuli and behavioural reactions. Most reward discriminations reflect the animals' relative preference among the available rewards, as expressed by their choice behaviour, rather than physical reward properties. Thus, neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex appear to process the motivational value of rewarding outcomes of voluntary action.},

	Abstract = {Reward is important for shaping goal-directed behaviour. After stimulus-reward associative learning, an organism can assess the motivational value of the incoming stimuli on the basis of past experience (retrospective processing), and predict forthcoming rewarding events (prospective processing). The traditional role of the sensory thalamus is to relay current sensory information to cortex. Here we find that non-primary thalamic neurons respond to reward-related events in two ways. The early, phasic responses occurred shortly after the onset of the stimuli and depended on the sensory modality. Their magnitudes resisted extinction and correlated with the learning experience. The late responses gradually increased during the cue and delay periods, and peaked just before delivery of the reward. These responses were independent of sensory modality and were modulated by the value and timing of the reward. These observations provide new evidence that single thalamic neurons can code for the acquired significance of sensory stimuli in the early responses (retrospective coding) and predict upcoming reward value in the late responses (prospective coding).},

	Abstract = {We investigated how orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contributes to adaptability in the face of changing reward contingencies by examining how reward representations in monkey orbitofrontal neurons change during a visually cued, multi-trial reward schedule task. A large proportion of orbitofrontal neurons were sensitive to events in this task (69/80 neurons in the valid and 48/58 neurons in the random cue context). Neuronal activity depended upon preceding reward, upcoming reward, reward delivery, and schedule state. Preceding reward-dependent activity occurred in both the valid and random cue contexts, whereas upcoming reward-dependent activity was observed only in the valid context. A greater proportion of neurons encoded preceding reward in the random than the valid cue context. The proportion of neurons with preceding reward-dependent activity declined as each trial progressed, whereas the proportion encoding upcoming reward increased. Reward information was represented by ensembles of neurons, the composition of which changed with task context and time. Overall, neuronal activity in OFC adapted to reflect the importance of different types of reward information in different contexts and time periods. This contextual and temporal adaptability is one hallmark of neurons participating in executive functions.},

	Abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex has been hypothesized to carry information regarding the value of expected rewards. Such information is essential for associative learning, which relies on comparisons between expected and obtained reward for generating instructive error signals. These error signals are thought to be conveyed by dopamine neurons. To test whether orbitofrontal cortex contributes to these error signals, we recorded from dopamine neurons in orbitofrontal-lesioned rats performing a reward learning task. Lesions caused marked changes in dopaminergic error signaling. However, the effect of lesions was not consistent with a simple loss of information regarding expected value. Instead, without orbitofrontal input, dopaminergic error signals failed to reflect internal information about the impending response that distinguished externally similar states leading to differently valued future rewards. These results are consistent with current conceptualizations of orbitofrontal cortex as supporting model-based behavior and suggest an unexpected role for this information in dopaminergic error signaling.},

	Abstract = {Gamma frequency field oscillations (40-100 Hz) are nested within theta oscillations in the dentate-hilar and CA1-CA3 regions of the hippocampus during exploratory behaviors. These oscillations reflect synchronized synaptic potentials that entrain the discharge of neuronal populations within the approximately 10-25 msec range. Using multisite recordings in freely behaving rats, we examined gamma oscillations within the superficial layers (I-III) of the entorhinal cortex. These oscillations increased in amplitude and regularity in association with entorhinal theta waves. Gamma waves showed an amplitude minimum and reversed in phase near the perisomatic region of layer II, indicating that they represent synchronized synaptic potentials impinging on layer II-III neurons. Theta and gamma oscillations in the entorhinal cortex were coupled with theta and gamma oscillations in the dentate hilar region. The majority of layer II-III neurons discharged irregularly but were phase-related to the negative peak of the local (layer II-III) gamma field oscillation. These findings demonstrate that layer II-III neurons discharge in temporally defined gamma windows (approximately 10-25 msec) coupled to the theta cycle. This transient temporal framework, which emerges in both the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, may allow spatially distributed subpopulations to form temporally defined ensembles. We speculate that the theta-gamma pattern in the discharge of these neurons is essential for effective neuronal communication and synaptic plasticity in the perforant pathway.},

	Abstract = {Dopamine has a central role in motivation and reward. Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) signal the discrepancy between expected and actual rewards (that is, reward prediction error), but how they compute such signals is unknown. We recorded the activity of VTA neurons while mice associated different odour cues with appetitive and aversive outcomes. We found three types of neuron based on responses to odours and outcomes: approximately half of the neurons (type I, 52%) showed phasic excitation after reward-predicting odours and rewards in a manner consistent with reward prediction error coding; the other half of neurons showed persistent activity during the delay between odour and outcome that was modulated positively (type II, 31%) or negatively (type III, 18%) by the value of outcomes. Whereas the activity of type I neurons was sensitive to actual outcomes (that is, when the reward was delivered as expected compared to when it was unexpectedly omitted), the activity of type II and type III neurons was determined predominantly by reward-predicting odours. We 'tagged' dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons with the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them based on their responses to optical stimulation while recording. All identified dopaminergic neurons were of type I and all GABAergic neurons were of type II. These results show that VTA GABAergic neurons signal expected reward, a key variable for dopaminergic neurons to calculate reward prediction error.},

	Abstract = {Episodic memory is characterized by rapid formation of new associations that bind information within individual episodes. A powerful aspect of episodic memory is the ability to flexibly apply and recombine information from past experience to guide new behavior. A critical question for memory research is how medial temporal lobe (MTL) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), regions implicated in rapid within-episode binding, further support cross-episode binding in service of mnemonic flexibility. We set to answer this question using an associative inference task in humans that required rapid binding of information across overlapping experiences (AB, BC) to enable successful transfer to novel test probes (AC). Within regions predicting subsequent associative memory for directly learned associations, encoding activation in MTL, including hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, uniquely predicted success on novel transfer trials both within and across participants, consistent with an integrative encoding mechanism where overlapping experiences are linked into a combined representation during learning. In contrast, during retrieval, PFC activation predicted trial-by-trial transfer success while MTL predicted transfer performance across participants. Moreover, increased MTL-PFC coupling was observed during novel transfer trials compared with retrieval of directly learned associations. These findings suggest that inferential processes support transfer of rapidly acquired experiences to novel events during retrieval where multiple memories are recalled and flexibly recombined in service of successful behavior. Together, these results demonstrate distinct encoding and retrieval mechanisms that support mnemonic flexibility, revealing a unique role for MTL regions in cross-episode binding during encoding and engagement of interactive MTL-PFC processes during flexible transfer at test.},

	Abstract = {Adapting successfully to new situations relies on integrating memory of similar circumstances with the outcomes of past actions. Here, we tested how reward history and recent memory influenced coding by orbital prefrontal cortex (OFC) neurons. Rats were trained to find food in plus maze tasks that required both the OFC and the hippocampus, and unit activity was recorded during stable performance, reversal learning, and strategy switching. OFC firing distinguished different rewarded paths, journeys from a start arm to a goal arm. Activity of individual cells and the population correlated with performance as rats learned newly rewarded outcomes. Activity was similar during reversal, an OFC-dependent task, and strategy switching, an OFC-independent task, suggesting that OFC associates information about paths and outcomes both when it is required for performance and when it is not. Path-selective OFC cells fired differently during overlapping journeys that led to different goals or from different starts, resembling journey-dependent coding by hippocampal neurons. Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded simultaneously in the OFC and the hippocampus oscillated coherently in the theta band (5-12 Hz) during stable performance. LFP coherence diminished when rats adapted to altered reward contingencies and followed different paths. Thus, OFC neurons appear to participate in a distributed network including the hippocampus that associates spatial paths, recent memory, and integrated reward history.},

	Abstract = {Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) function is often characterized in terms of stimulus-reward mapping; however, more recent evidence suggests that the OFC may play a role in selecting and representing extended actions. First, previously encoded reward associations in the OFC could be used to inform responding in novel but similar situations. Second, when evaluated in tasks requiring the animal to perform extended actions, response selective activity can be recorded in the OFC. Finally, the interaction between the OFC and hippocampus illustrates OFC's role in response selection. The OFC may facilitate reward-guided memory retrieval by selecting the memories most relevant to achieve a goal. This model for OFC function places it within the hierarchy of increasingly complex action representations that support decision making.},

Dorsal hippocampal lesions impaired Pavlovian conditioning in this task. They also produced a deficit in interval timing, replicating previous findings with short CSs. The conditioning and timing deficits observed are consistent with the findings from single-unit recording studies in other species, and suggest that the involvement of the dhpc in Pavlovian processes could be more general than is assumed by many of the current theories of hippocampal function.},

Performance is surprisingly poor compared with discrimination of the same stimuli. Existing models assume that identification is achieved using long-term representations of absolute magnitudes. The authors propose an alternative relative judgment model (RJM) in which the elemental perceptual units are representations of the differences between current and previous stimuli. These differences are used, together with the previous feedback, to respond. Without using long-term representations of absolute magnitudes, the RJM accounts for (a) information transmission limits, (b) bowed serial position effects, and (c) sequential effects, where responses are biased toward immediately preceding stimuli but away from more distant stimuli (assimilation and contrast).},

To determine how these responses are acquired and maintained, the authors recorded single OF units in rats performing an odor discrimination task. Approximately 64% of all cells differentiated between rewarded and nonrewarded odors. These odor valence responses changed during learning in 26% of all cells, and these changes were positively correlated with improving performance, supporting the idea that the information provided by these cells is used in learning the task. However, changes in odor valence responses were also observed after learning, and included not only increases in odor discrimination, but also decreases or mixed increases and decreases. Thus, only some of the changes in firing reflected acquisition of the task. The results suggest that learning triggers a continuing reorganization of OF neural ensembles representing odors and their rewards.},

	Abstract = {1. Neural activity was recorded from the orbitofrontal cortex (OF) of rats performing an eight-odor discrimination task that included predictable associations between particular odor pairs. A modified linear discriminant analysis was employed to characterize the population response in each trial of the task as a point in an N-dimensional activity space with the firing rate of each cell in the population represented on one of the N dimensions. The ability of the ensemble to discriminate among conditions of a variable was reflected in the tendency of population responses to cluster together in this activity space for repetitions of a given condition. We assessed coding of several variables describing the period of odor sampling, focusing on aspects of current, past, and future events reflected in single-neuron firing patterns, in ensembles composed of 22-138 cells active during the period when the rats sampled the discriminative stimulus in each trial. 2. OF ensembles performed well at discriminating variables with relevance to task demands represented in single-neuron firing patterns, specifically the physical attributes and assigned reward contingency of the current odor as well as the expectation of reward in the following trial that could be inferred from the predictable associations between particular pairs of odors. OF ensembles were able to correctly identify the identity and assigned reward contingency of the current odor in up to 52% (chance = 12.5%) and 99% (chance = 50%) of all trials, respectively, such that the observed behavioral performance required a population of 5,364 odor-responsive cells in the case of odor identity and only 40 cells in the case of valence. Expectations regarding upcoming rewards based on both assigned response contingency and associations between particular pairs of odors were correctly classified in up to 67% (chance = 20%) of all trials such that the observed level of behavioral performance required a population of 3,169 cells. 3. Other information represented in the single-neuron firing patterns, such as the identity and reward contingency of the preceding odor and specific odor-odor associations, was poorly encoded by OF ensembles. Thus neural ensembles in OF may represent only some of the information reflected in single-neuron activity. Stable coding of only the most useful and relevant information by the ensemble might emerge from the tuning properties of single neurons under the influence of the task at hand, producing in the well-trained animal the observed pattern of broad and diverse coding by single neurons and selective, task-relevant coding by neural ensembles in OF.},

	Abstract = {1. Extracellular spike activity was recorded from 1,942 single neurons in orbitofrontal cortex (OF) and 591 single neurons in pyriform cortex (PIR) over multiple sessions in rats performing an eight-odor discrimination task in which the stimulus sequence contained predictable associations between particular odor pairs. Neural firing patterns were examined in relation to task events in the current trial and variables associated with current sensory processing, events of recent past trials, and long-term associations involving the odor cues. 2. Overall, 34% of single neurons in OF and 30% of single neurons in PIR fired selectively during one or more salient trial events including trial initiation, odor sampling, performance of the discriminative response, and water consumption. The activity of other cells recorded in OF (13%) and PIR (10%) was suppressed for the duration of each trial. Although the proportion of some cell types differed between the two areas, the firing patterns of OF and PIR neurons were qualitatively indistinguishable. 3. Firing during odor sampling and the discriminative response was influenced by the identity of the current odor. Some cells fired selectively to a single odor, but most cells were coarsely tuned such that they fired to several of the eight odors to differing degrees consistent with previous reports. Considerable odor coding was observed in both OF and PIR. 4. Firing during trial initiation and odor sampling was also influenced by the identity and reward association of the odor presented in the immediately preceding trial. The influence of past odor identity and valence was observed in both OF and PIR. 5. Firing during trial events was also influenced by the acquired associations between odors and their assigned reward contingencies and between pairs of odors involved in predictive relationships. The reward valence of the current odor significantly influenced firing during odor sampling and the discriminative response; some cells responded preferentially to rewarded odors and others to nonrewarded odors. Firing during trial initiation and odor sampling reflected whether or not the odor in the current trial had been predicted by the odor in the preceding trial. In addition, firing during odor sampling reflected the expectation of reward in the following trial that could be inferred from the predictable associations between odors. Each of these properties was observed in both OF and PIR. 6. The findings in OF were consistent with the view that prefrontal subdivisions mediate the temporal organization of complex behaviors within specific informational domains. OF appears to be concerned with the specific domain of olfaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {It has been proposed that long-term declarative memories are ultimately stored through interactions between the hippocampal memory system and the neocortical association areas that initially processed the to-be-stored information. One association neocortex, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with the hippocampal memory system and plays an important role in odor recognition memory in rats. We will report data from two studies: one that examined the firing of neurons in a task dependent on the parahippocampal region (PHR; including the perirhinal, postrhinal, and entrorhinal cortices), and one examined the firing of OFC neurons performing a task that is presumably dependent on the hippocampus. In the first study, we examined the role of OFC neurons in the continuous odor-guided nonmatching to sample task. While the firing of neurons in the PHR and OFC are similar in this task, there are several notable differences that are consistent with the idea that OFC is a high-order association cortex which interacts extensively with the PHR to store declarative memories. In the second study, we characterized the firing patterns of neurons in the OFC rats performing a passive, 8-odor-sequence memory task. Most interesting were neurons that fired selectively in anticipation of specific odors. We found that hippocampal lesions abolished the anticipatory firing in OFC, suggesting that these anticipatory responses (memory) were in fact dependent on the hippocampus, further supporting the view that the OFC interacts with the hippocampal memory system to store long-term, declarative memories.},

	Abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex (OF) is strongly and reciprocally connected with the perirhinal (PR) and entorhinal areas of the medial temporal lobe and plays an important role in odor recognition memory. This study characterized firing patterns of single neurons in the OF of rats performing a continuous odor-guided delayed nonmatch to sample (DNMS) task. Most OF neurons fired in association with one or more task events, including the initiation of trials, the sampling of odor stimuli, and the consumption of rewards. OF neurons also exhibited sustained odor-selective activity during the memory delay, and a large proportion of OF cells had odor-specific enhanced or suppressed responses on stimulus repetition. Most OF neurons were activated during several task events, or associated with complex behavioral states. The incidence of cells that fired in association with the critical match/non-match judgement was increased as the DNMS rule was learned, and was higher in OF than in perirhinal and entorhinal cortex. Furthermore, the classification of match and nonmatch trials was correlated with accuracy in performance of that judgement. These findings are consistent with the view that OF is a high order association cortex that plays a role both in the memory representations for specific stimuli and in the acquisition and application of task rules.},

	Abstract = {Contextual representations serve to guide many aspects of behavior and influence the way stimuli or actions are encoded and interpreted. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), including the anterior cingulate subregion, has been implicated in contextual encoding, yet the nature of contextual representations formed by the mPFC is unclear. Using multiple single-unit tetrode recordings in rats, we found that different activity patterns emerged in mPFC ensembles when animals moved between different environmental contexts. These differences in activity patterns were significantly larger than those observed for hippocampal ensembles. Whereas ≈11% of mPFC cells consistently preferred one environment over the other across multiple exposures to the same environments, optimal decoding (prediction) of the environmental setting occurred when the activity of up to ≈50% of all mPFC neurons was taken into account. On the other hand, population activity patterns were not identical upon repeated exposures to the very same environment. This was partly because the state of mPFC ensembles seemed to systematically shift with time, such that we could sometimes predict the change in ensemble state upon later reentry into one environment according to linear extrapolation from the time-dependent shifts observed during the first exposure. We also observed that many strongly action-selective mPFC neurons exhibited a significant degree of context-dependent modulation. These results highlight potential differences in contextual encoding schemes by the mPFC and hippocampus and suggest that the mPFC forms rich contextual representations that take into account not only sensory cues but also actions and time.},

	Abstract = {In 1974, Baddeley and Hitch proposed a three-component model of working memory. Over the years, this has been successful in giving an integrated account not only of data from normal adults, but also neuropsychological, developmental and neuroimaging data. There are, however, a number of phenomena that are not readily captured by the original model. These are outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory.},

Observers are also able to retain both the color and the orientation of 3-4 objects, indicating that visual working memory stores integrated objects rather than individual features. Indeed, objects defined by a conjunction of four features can be retained in working memory just as well as single-feature objects, allowing many individual features to be retained when distributed across a small number of objects. Thus, the capacity of visual working memory must be understood in terms of integrated objects rather than individual features.},

	Abstract = {The basal ganglia (BG) have been hypothesized to implement a reinforcement learning algorithm. However, it is not clear how information is processed along this network, thus enabling it to perform its functional role. Here we present three different encoding schemes of visual cues associated with rewarding, neutral, and aversive outcomes by BG neuronal populations. We studied the response profile and dynamical behavior of two populations of projection neurons [striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), and neurons in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe)], and one neuromodulator group [striatal tonically active neurons (TANs)] from behaving monkeys. MSNs and GPe neurons displayed sustained average activity to cue presentation. The population average response of MSNs was composed of three distinct response groups that were temporally differentiated and fired in serial episodes along the trial. In the GPe, the average sustained response was composed of two response groups that were primarily differentiated by their immediate change in firing rate direction. However, unlike MSNs, neurons in both GPe response groups displayed prolonged and temporally overlapping persistent activity. The putamen TANs stereotyped response was characterized by a single transient response group. Finally, the MSN and GPe response groups reorganized at the outcome epoch, as different task events were reflected in different response groups. Our results strengthen the functional separation between BG neuromodulators and main axis neurons. Furthermore, they reveal dynamically changing cell assemblies in the striatal network of behaving primates. Finally, they support the functional convergence of the MSN response groups onto GPe cells.},

	Abstract = {Our ability to remember new information is often compromised by competition from prior learning, leading to many instances of forgetting. One of the challenges in studying why these lapses occur and how they can be prevented is that it is methodologically difficult to "see" competition between memories as it occurs. Here, we used multi-voxel pattern analysis of human fMRI data to measure the neural reactivation of both older (competing) and newer (target) memories during individual attempts to retrieve newer memories. Of central interest was the following: (1) whether older memories were reactivated during retrieval of newer memories; (2) how reactivation of older memories related to retrieval performance; and (3) whether neural mechanisms engaged during the encoding of newer memories were predictive of neural competition experienced during retrieval. Our results indicate that older and newer visual memories were often simultaneously reactivated in ventral temporal cortex-even when target memories were successfully retrieved. Importantly, stronger reactivation of older memories was associated with less accurate retrieval of newer memories, slower mnemonic decisions, and increased activity in anterior cingulate cortex. Finally, greater activity in the inferior frontal gyrus during the encoding of newer memories (memory updating) predicted lower competition in ventral temporal cortex during subsequent retrieval. Together, these results provide novel insight into how older memories compete with newer memories and specify neural mechanisms that allow competition to be overcome and memories to be updated.},

	Abstract = {Dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopamine system results in marked disorders of movement such as occur in Parkinson's disease. Functions of this dopamine-containing projection system were examined in monkeys trained in a classical conditioning task, and the effects of striatal dopamine depletion were tested. Unilateral dopamine loss substantially reduced the acquired sensory responsiveness of striatal neurons monitored electrophysiologically. This effect was ipsilateral and selective, and could be reversed by apomorphine. These results suggest that the primate nigrostriatal system modulates expression of neuronal response plasticity in the striatum during sensorimotor learning.},

	Abstract = {Evaluation of both immediate and future outcomes of one's actions is a critical requirement for intelligent behavior. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated brain mechanisms for reward prediction at different time scales in a Markov decision task. When human subjects learned actions on the basis of immediate rewards, significant activity was seen in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the striatum. When subjects learned to act in order to obtain large future rewards while incurring small immediate losses, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, dorsal raphe nucleus and cerebellum were also activated. Computational model-based regression analysis using the predicted future rewards and prediction errors estimated from subjects' performance data revealed graded maps of time scale within the insula and the striatum: ventroanterior regions were involved in predicting immediate rewards and dorsoposterior regions were involved in predicting future rewards. These results suggest differential involvement of the cortico-basal ganglia loops in reward prediction at different time scales.},

	Abstract = {Network oscillations support transient communication across brain structures. We show here, in rats, that task-related neuronal activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), the hippocampus, and the ventral tegmental area (VTA), regions critical for working memory, is coordinated by a 4 Hz oscillation. A prominent increase of power and coherence of the 4 Hz oscillation in the PFC and the VTA and its phase modulation of gamma power in both structures was present in the working memory part of the task. Subsets of both PFC and hippocampal neurons predicted the turn choices of the rat. The goal-predicting PFC pyramidal neurons were more strongly phase locked to both 4 Hz and hippocampal theta oscillations than nonpredicting cells. The 4 Hz and theta oscillations were phase coupled and jointly modulated both gamma waves and neuronal spikes in the PFC, the VTA, and the hippocampus. Thus, multiplexed timing mechanisms in the PFC-VTA-hippocampus axis may support processing of information, including working memory.},

Current functional thinking does not fully incorporate the intricately connected networks that link these subregions, owing to their organizational complexity; however, such detailed anatomical knowledge is of pivotal importance for comprehending the unique functional contribution of each subregion. We have therefore developed an interactive diagram with the aim to display all of the currently known anatomical connections of the rat parahippocampal-hippocampal network. In this Review, we integrate the existing anatomical knowledge into a concise description of this network and discuss the functional implications of some relatively underexposed connections.},

In this proposal, analogies are derived from elementary information that is extracted rapidly from the input, to link that input with the representations that exist in memory. Finding an analogical link results in the generation of focused predictions via associative activation of representations that are relevant to this analogy, in the given context. Predictions in complex circumstances, such as social interactions, combine multiple analogies. Such predictions need not be created afresh in new situations, but rather rely on existing scripts in memory, which are the result of real as well as of previously imagined experiences. This cognitive neuroscience framework provides a new hypothesis with which to consider the purpose of memory, and can help explain a variety of phenomena, ranging from recognition to first impressions, and from the brain's 'default mode' to a host of mental disorders.},

We proposed that this region should instead be seen as intrinsically mediating contextual associations and not place/scene processing or episodic memory exclusively. Given that place/scene processing and episodic memory both rely on associations, this modified framework provides a platform for reconciling what seemed like different roles assigned to the same region. Comparing scenes with scenes, we show here that the PHC responds significantly more strongly to scenes with rich contextual associations compared with scenes of equal visual qualities but less associations. This result adds unequivocal support to the view that the PHC mediates contextual associations in general rather than places or scenes proper, and necessitates a revision of the current view that the PHC contains a dedicated place/scenes "module."},

	Abstract = {The neural mechanisms that integrate new episodes with established memories are unknown. When rats explore an environment, CA1 cells fire in place fields that indicate locations. In goal-directed spatial memory tasks, some place fields differentiate behavioral histories ("journey-dependent" place fields) while others do not ("journey-independent" place fields). To investigate how these signals inform learning and memory for new and familiar episodes, we recorded CA1 and CA3 activity in rats trained to perform a "standard" spatial memory task in a plus maze and in two new task variants. A "switch" task exchanged the start and goal locations in the same environment; an "altered environment" task contained unfamiliar local and distal cues. In the switch task, performance was mildly impaired, new firing maps were stable, but the proportion and stability of journey-dependent place fields declined. In the altered environment, overall performance was strongly impaired, new firing maps were unstable, and stable proportions of journey-dependent place fields were maintained. In both tasks, memory errors were accompanied by a decline in journey codes. The different dynamics of place and journey coding suggest that they reflect separate mechanisms and contribute to distinct memory computations. Stable place fields may represent familiar relationships among environmental features that are required for consistent memory performance. Journey-dependent activity may correspond with goal-directed behavioral sequences that reflect expectancies that generalize across environments. The complementary signals could help link current events with established memories, so that familiarity with either a behavioral strategy or an environment can inform goal-directed learning.},

	Abstract = {Midbrain dopamine neurons are activated when reward is greater than predicted, and this error signal could teach target neurons both the value of reward and when it will occur. We used the dopamine error signal to measure how the expectation of reward was distributed over time. Animals were trained with fixed-duration intervals of 1-16 s between conditioned stimulus onset and reward. In contrast to the weak responses that have been observed after short intervals (1-2 s), activations to reward increased steeply and linearly with the logarithm of the interval. Results with varied stimulus-reward intervals suggest that the neural expectation was substantial after just half an interval had elapsed. Thus, the neural expectation of reward in these experiments was not highly precise and the precision declined sharply with interval duration. The neural precision of expectation appeared to be at least qualitatively similar to the precision of anticipatory licking behavior.},

	Abstract = {Activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors on pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex induces the appearance of a slow afterdepolarization that can sustain autonomous spiking after a brief excitatory stimulus. Accordingly, this phenomenon has been hypothesized to allow for the transient storage of memory traces in neuronal networks. Here we investigated the molecular basis underlying the muscarinic receptor-induced afterdepolarization using molecular biological and electrophysiological strategies. We find that the ability of muscarinic receptors to induce the inward aftercurrent underlying the slow afterdepolarization is inhibited by expression of a Galpha(q-11) dominant negative and is also markedly reduced in a phospholipase C beta1 (PLCbeta1) knock-out mouse. Furthermore, we show, using a genetically encoded biosensor, that activation of muscarinic receptor induces the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in pyramidal cells. These results indicate that the Galpha(q-11)/PLCbeta1 cascade plays a key role in the ability of muscarinic receptors to signal the inward aftercurrent. We have shown previously that the muscarinic afterdepolarization is mediated by a calcium-activated nonselective cation current, suggesting the possible involvement of TRPC channels. We find that expression of a TRPC dominant negative inhibits, and overexpression of wild-type TRPC5 or TRPC6 enhances, the amplitude of the muscarinic receptor-induced inward aftercurrent. Furthermore, we find that coexpression of TRPC5 and T-type calcium channels is sufficient to reconstitute a muscarinic receptor-activated inward aftercurrent in human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells. These results indicate that TRPC channels mediate the muscarinic receptor-induced slow afterdepolarization seen in pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and suggest a possible role for TRPC channels in mnemonic processes.},

	Abstract = {The intrinsic properties of neurons that enable them to maintain depolarized, persistently activated states in the absence of sustained input are poorly understood. In short-term memory tasks, individual prefrontal cortical (PFC) neurons can maintain persistent action potential output during delay periods between informative cues and behavioral responses. Dopamine and drugs of abuse alter PFC function and working memory, possibly by modulating intrinsic neuronal properties. Here we used patch-clamp recording of layer 5 PFC pyramidal neurons to identify a postsynaptic depolarization that was evoked by action potential bursts and mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). This depolarization occurred in the absence of recurrent synaptic activity and was reduced by a dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) protein kinase A pathway. After behavioral sensitization to cocaine, the depolarization was substantially diminished and D1R modulation was lost. We propose that burst-evoked intrinsic depolarization is a form of short-term cellular memory that is modulated by dopamine and cocaine experience.},

	Abstract = {Persistent neuronal activity lasting seconds to minutes has been proposed to allow for the transient storage of memory traces in entorhinal cortex and thus could play a major role in working memory. Nonsynaptic plateau potentials induced by acetylcholine account for persistent firing in many cortical and subcortical structures. The expression of these intrinsic properties in cortical neurons involves the recruitment of a non-selective cation conductance. Despite its functional importance, the identity of the cation channels remains unknown. Here we show that, in layer V of rat medial entorhinal cortex, muscarinic receptor-evoked plateau potentials and persistent firing induced by carbachol require phospholipase C activation, decrease of PIP(2) levels, and permissive intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. Plateau potentials and persistent activity were suppressed by the generic nonselective cation channel blockers FFA (100 μM) and 2-APB (100 μM), as well as by the TRPC channel blocker SKF-96365 (50 μM). However, plateau potentials were not affected by the TRPV channel blocker ruthenium red (40 μM). The TRPC3/6/7 activator OAG did not induce or enhance persistent firing evoked by carbachol. Voltage clamp recordings revealed a carbachol-activated, nonselective cationic current with a heteromeric TRPC-like phenotype. Moreover, plateau potentials and persistent firing were inhibited by intracellular application of the peptide EQVTTRL that disrupts interactions between the C-terminal domain of TRPC4/5 subunits and associated PDZ proteins. Altogether, our data suggest that TRPC cation channels mediating persistent muscarinic currents significantly contribute to the firing and mnemonic properties of projection neurons in the entorhinal cortex.},

	Abstract = {The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a limbic region associated with pain-related working memory and memory acquisition, receives a dense cholinergic innervation. To further understand the role of acetylcholine in ACC, we characterized the firing properties of pyramidal neurons following muscarinic receptor activation. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings in acute brain slices, we report long-lasting nonsynaptic plateau potentials and persistent firing induced by carbachol (CCh) in pyramidal neurons in layers II/III of rat ACC. CCh responses were abolished by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine or by inhibitors of G proteins and phospholipase C. Inhibiting L-type calcium channels with nifedipine, removing extracellular calcium or chelating intracellular calcium with BAPTA also abolished plateau potentials and persistent firing. Blockade of nonselective cation channels with flufenamic acid, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate or SKF-96365 suppressed CCh responses and voltage-clamp recordings of CCh-sensitive currents revealed a transient receptor potential canonical-like cationic conductance. The group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine hydrate induced plateau potentials and persistent firing that were mediated by mGluR5. Our data demonstrate that receptor-operated channels drive calcium-dependent plateau potentials and persistent firing in layers II/III of ACC. Therefore, acetylcholine- and glutamate-evoked persistent activity in ACC may play a mnemonic role by allowing transient storage of information during pain processing.},

This persistent firing is maintained even if the rat is motionless, when spatial cues are removed from the environment and in the dark, but the mechanism that supports persistent firing of the head direction cells is still unclear. Here, using in vitro whole-cell patch recording, we found that a short-triggering stimulus (as few as five induced spikes) can initiate persistent firing in cells of the postsubiculum. Pharmacological results indicated that this persistent firing is driven by a calcium-sensitive nonselective cation current. The distribution of cells with persistent firing in superficial and deep layers in the postsubiculum was similar to that of head direction cells. These results suggest that persistent firing of head direction cells in the postsubiculum could be supported by an intrinsic mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Persistent-firing neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) continue to discharge long after the termination of the original, spike-initiating current. An emerging theory proposes that endogenous persistent firing helps support a transient memory system. This study demonstrated that persistent-firing neurons are also prevalent in rat perirhinal cortex (PR), which lies immediately adjacent to and is reciprocally connected with EC and LA. Several characteristics of persistent-firing neurons in PR were similar to those previously reported in LA and EC. Persistent firing in PR was enabled by the application of carbachol, a nonselective cholinergic agonist, and it was induced by injecting a suprathreshold current or by stimulating suprathreshold excitatory synaptic inputs to the neuron. Once induced, persistent firing lasted for seconds to minutes. Persistent firing could always be terminated by a sufficiently large and prolonged hyperpolarizing current; it was prevented by antagonists of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs); and it was blocked by flufenamic acid. The latter has been suggested to inhibit a Ca(2+) -activated nonspecific cation conductance (G(CAN) ) that normally furnishes the sustained depolarization during persistent firing. In many PR neurons, the discharge rate during persistent firing was a graded function of depolarizing and/or hyperpolarizing inputs. Persistent firing was not prevented by blocking fast excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, demonstrating that it can be generated endogenously. We suggest that persistent-firing neurons in PR, EC, LA, and certain other brain regions may cooperate in support of a transient-memory system. {\copyright} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Here we propose an alternative explanation of this phenomenon based on methodological constraints regarding the direction of time, which cannot be manipulated in experimental settings. In two experiments, we demonstrate the influence of the direction of a dimensional change for pitch and brightness estimates. The results support the assumption that errors in time reproduction tasks do not reflect a systematic temporal misperception, but rather a method- ological artifact.

	Abstract = {Classical amnesia involves selective memory impairment for temporally distant items in free recall (impaired primacy) together with relative preservation of memory for recency items. This abnormal serial position curve is traditionally taken as evidence for a distinction between different memory processes, with amnesia being associated with selectively impaired long-term memory. However recent accounts of normal serial position curves have emphasized the importance of rehearsal processes in giving rise to primacy effects and have suggested that a single temporal distinctiveness mechanism can account for both primacy and recency effects when rehearsal is considered. Here we explore the pattern of strategic rehearsal in a patient with very severe amnesia. When the patient's rehearsal pattern is taken into account, a temporal distinctiveness model can account for the serial position curve in both amnesic and control free recall. The results are taken as consistent with temporal distinctiveness models of free recall, and they motivate an emphasis on rehearsal patterns in understanding amnesic deficits in free recall.},

	Abstract = {Consolidation is the progressive postacquisition stabilization of long-term memory. The term is commonly used to refer to two types of processes: synaptic consolidation, which is accomplished within the first minutes to hours after learning and occurs in all memory systems studied so far; and system consolidation, which takes much longer, and in which memories that are initially dependent upon the hippocampus undergo reorganization and may become hippocampal-independent. The textbook account of consolidation is that for any item in memory, consolidation starts and ends just once. Recently, a heated debate has been revitalized on whether this is indeed the case, or, alternatively, whether memories become labile and must undergo some form of renewed consolidation every time they are activated. This debate focuses attention on fundamental issues concerning the nature of the memory trace, its maturation, persistence, retrievability, and modifiability.},

	Abstract = {The term working memory refers to a brain system that provides temporary storage and manipulation of the information necessary for such complex cognitive tasks as language comprehension, learning, and reasoning. This definition has evolved from the concept of a unitary short-term memory system. Working memory has been found to require the simultaneous storage and processing of information. It can be divided into the following three subcomponents: (i) the central executive, which is assumed to be an attentional-controlling system, is important in skills such as chess playing and is particularly susceptible to the effects of Alzheimer's disease; and two slave systems, namely (ii) the visuospatial sketch pad, which manipulates visual images and (iii) the phonological loop, which stores and rehearses speech-based information and is necessary for the acquisition of both native and second-language vocabulary.},

	Abstract = {Can we learn without awareness? Although this issue has been extensively explored through studies of implicit learning, there is currently no agreement about the extent to which knowledge can be acquired and projected onto performance in an unconscious way. The controversy, like that surrounding implicit memory, seems to be at least in part attributable to unquestioned acceptance of the unrealistic assumption that tasks are process-pure--that is, that a given task exclusively involves either implicit or explicit knowledge. Methods such as the process dissociation procedure (PDP, Jacoby, 1991) have been developed to overcome the conceptual limitations of the process purity assumption but have seldom been used in the context of implicit learning research. In this paper, we show how the PDP can be applied to a free generation task so as to disentangle explicit and implicit sequence learning. Our results indicate that subjects who are denied preparation to the next stimulus nevertheless exhibit knowledge of the sequence through their reaction time performance despite remaining unable (1) to project this knowledge in a recognition task and (2) to refrain from expressing their knowledge when specifically instructed to do so. These findings provide strong evidence that sequence learning can be unconscious.},

	Abstract = {Prefrontal (PF) cells were studied in monkeys performing a delayed matching to sample task, which requires working memory. The stimuli were complex visual patterns and to solve the task, the monkeys had to discriminate among the stimuli, maintain a memory of the sample stimulus during the delay periods, and evaluate whether a test stimulus matched the sample presented earlier in the trial. PF cells have properties consistent with a role in all three of these operations. Approximately 25% of the cells responded selectively to different visual stimuli. Half of the cells showed heightened activity during the delay after the sample and, for many of these cells, the magnitude of delay activity was selective for different samples. Finally, more than half of the cells responded differently to the test stimuli depending on whether they matched the sample. Because inferior temporal (IT) cortex also is important for working memory, we compared PF cells with IT cells studied in the same task. Compared with IT cortex, PF responses were less often stimulus-selective but conveyed more information about whether a given test stimulus was a match to the sample. Furthermore, sample-selective delay activity in PF cortex was maintained throughout the trial even when other test stimuli intervened during the delay, whereas delay activity in IT cortex was disrupted by intervening stimuli. The results suggest that PF cortex plays a primary role in working memory tasks and may be a source of feedback inputs to IT cortex, biasing activity in favor of behaviorally relevant stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Episodic memory, the recollection of past events in one's life, has often been considered a memory specific to humans. Recent work in a variety of species has challenged this view, and has raised important questions about the nature of episodic memory itself. We present a review of the types of task proposed as episodic-like in animals and consider that these tasks require animals to demonstrate memory for specific occasions in the past. We propose that identifying episodic memory as the memory for what happened where on a specific occasion is a more encompassing definition than one that relies on information about when an event occurred. These episodic-like tasks in animals support the view that the hippocampal system is necessary for episodic memory, and that the neural substrates of episodic memory can be dissociated from those of other forms of declarative memory.},

	Abstract = {Loss of cholinergic cortical input is associated with diseases in which episodic memory impairment is a prominent feature, but the degree to which this neurochemical lesion can account for memory impairment in humans with neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Removal of cholinergic input to hippocampus impairs some of its functions in memory, perhaps by reducing the plasticity of information representation within the hippocampus, but the role of cholinergic hippocampal input in episodic-like memories has not been investigated. To address this question, we tested rats with selective lesions of basal forebrain neurons in the medial septum and vertical limb of the diagonal band (MS/VDB), which contains hippocampal-projecting cholinergic neurons, on a task of integrated memory for objects, places, and contexts ("what-where-which" memory). This task serves as a rodent model of human episodic memory (episodic-like memory) and is sensitive to damage to the hippocampal system. Rats with lesions of cholinergic MS/VDB neurons performed as well on the what-where-which task as controls, but were impaired in a task that simply required them to associate places with contexts ("where-which" memory). Thus, episodic-like memories that rely on the hippocampus do not require cholinergic neuromodulation to be formed. Nevertheless, some more specific aspects of where-which memory, which may be more dependent on the plasticity of hippocampal spatial representations, require acetylcholine. These results suggest that cholinergic projections to hippocampus are not necessary for episodic memory and, furthermore, that hippocampal spatial representations may be to some extent dissociable from episodic memory function. {\copyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

A novel task based on the spontaneous recognition paradigm is presented that requires memory for these three aspects. This task is performed easily by intact rats at delays of up to 1 hr. However, performance of the task is severely and selectively disrupted by transection of the fornix. Ability to perform this task is discussed in relation to models of episodic memory in animals, and we suggest that this task provides a simple and useful animal model of episodic memory for use with rats.},

We report here that representation of the environment by "place" cells is altered by changing synaptic weights within hippocampal networks. Long-term potentiation (LTP) of intrinsic hippocampal pathways abolished existing place fields, created new place fields, and rearranged the temporal relationship within the affected population. The effect of LTP on neuron discharge was rate and context dependent. The LTP-induced "remapping" occurred without affecting the global firing rate of the network. The findings support the view that learned place representation can be accomplished by LTP-like synaptic plasticity within intrahippocampal networks.},

@article{Buzs05,
	Abstract = {Five key topics have been reverberating in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (EC) research over the past five decades: episodic and semantic memory, path integration ("dead reckoning") and landmark ("map") navigation, and theta oscillation. We suggest that the systematic relations between single cell discharge and the activity of neuronal ensembles reflected in local field theta oscillations provide a useful insight into the relationship among these terms. In rats trained to run in direction-guided (1-dimensional) tasks, hippocampal cell assemblies discharge sequentially, with different assemblies active on opposite runs, i.e., place cells are unidirectional. Such tasks do not require map representation and are formally identical with learning sequentially occurring items in an episode. Hebbian plasticity, acting within the temporal window of the theta cycle, converts the travel distances into synaptic strengths between the sequentially activated and unidirectionally connected assemblies. In contrast, place representations by hippocampal neurons in 2-dimensional environments are typically omnidirectional, characteristic of a map. Generation of a map requires exploration, essentially a dead reckoning behavior. We suggest that omnidirectional navigation through the same places (junctions) during exploration gives rise to omnidirectional place cells and, consequently, maps free of temporal context. Analogously, multiple crossings of common junction(s) of episodes convert the common junction(s) into context-free or semantic memory. Theta oscillation can hence be conceived as the navigation rhythm through both physical and mnemonic space, facilitating the formation of maps and episodic/semantic memories.},

@article{JezeHenr11,
	Abstract = {The ability to recall discrete memories is thought to depend on the formation of attractor states in recurrent neural networks. In such networks, representations can be reactivated reliably from subsets of the cues that were present when the memory was encoded, at the same time as interference from competing representations is minimized. Theoretical studies have pointed to the recurrent CA3 system of the hippocampus as a possible attractor network. Consistent with predictions from these studies, experiments have shown that place representations in CA3 and downstream CA1 tolerate small changes in the configuration of the environment but switch to uncorrelated representations when dissimilarities become larger. However, the kinetics supporting such network transitions, at the subsecond timescale, is poorly understood. Here we show in rats that instantaneous transformation of the spatial context does not change the hippocampal representation all at once but is followed by temporary bistability in the discharge activity of CA3 ensembles. Rather than sliding through a continuum of intermediate activity states, the CA3 network undergoes a short period of competitive flickering between preformed representations of the past and present environment before settling on the latter. Network flickers are extremely fast, often with complete replacement of the active ensemble from one theta cycle to the next. Within individual cycles, segregation is stronger towards the end, when firing starts to decline, pointing to the theta cycle as a temporal unit for expression of attractor states in the hippocampus. Repetition of pattern-completion processes across successive theta cycles may facilitate error correction and enhance discriminative power in the presence of weak and ambiguous input cues.},

The authors propose a model in which place fields of hippocampal pyramidal cells are formed by linear summation of appropriately weighted inputs from entorhinal grid cells. Single confined place fields could be formed by summing input from a modest number (10-50) of grid cells with relatively similar grid phases, diverse grid orientations, and a biologically plausible range of grid spacings. When the spatial phase variation in the grid-cell input was higher, multiple, and irregularly spaced firing fields were formed. These observations point to a number of possible constraints in the organization of functional connections between grid cells and place cells.},

	Abstract = {Flexible decision-making strategies (such as planning) are a key component of adaptive behavior, yet their neural mechanisms have remained resistant to experimental analysis. Theories of planning require prediction and evaluation of potential future rewards, suggesting that reward signals may covertly appear at decision points. To test this idea, we recorded ensembles of ventral striatal neurons on a spatial decision task, in which hippocampal ensembles are known to represent future possibilities at decision points. We found representations of reward which were not only activated at actual reward delivery sites, but also at a high-cost choice point and before error correction. This expectation-of-reward signal at decision points was apparent at both the single cell and the ensemble level, and vanished with behavioral automation. We conclude that ventral striatal representations of reward are more dynamic than suggested by previous reports of reward- and cue-responsive cells, and may provide the necessary signal for evaluation of internally generated possibilities considered during flexible decision-making.},

	Abstract = {A functional interaction between the hippocampal formation and the ventral striatum is thought to contribute to the learning and expression of associations between places and rewards. However, the mechanism of how such associations may be learned and used is currently unknown. We recorded neural ensembles and local field potentials from the ventral striatum and CA1 simultaneously as rats ran a modified T-maze. Theta-modulated cells in ventral striatum almost invariably showed firing phase precession relative to the hippocampal theta rhythm. Across the population of ventral striatal cells, phase precession was preferentially associated with an anticipatory ramping of activity up to the reward sites. In contrast, CA1 population activity and phase precession were distributed more uniformly. Ventral striatal phase precession was stronger to hippocampal than ventral striatal theta and was accompanied by increased theta coherence with hippocampus, suggesting that this effect is hippocampally derived. These results suggest that the firing phase of ventral striatal neurons contains motivationally relevant information and that phase precession serves to bind hippocampal place representations to ventral striatal representations of reward.},

	Abstract = {The principle that the standard deviation of estimates scales with the mean estimate, commonly known as the scalar property, is one of the most broadly accepted fundamentals of interval timing. This property is measured using the coefficient of variation (CV) calculated as the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean. In 1997, John Gibbon suggested that different time measurement mechanisms may have different levels of absolute precision, and would therefore be associated with different CVs. Here, we test this proposal by examining the CVs produced by human subjects timing a broad range of intervals (68 ms to 16.7 min). Our data reveal no evidence for multiple mechanisms, but instead show a continuous logarithmic decrease in CV as timed intervals increase. This finding joins other recent reports in demonstrating a systematic violation of the scalar property in timing data. Interestingly, the estimated CV of circadian judgements fits onto the regression of decreasing CV, suggesting a link between short interval and circadian timing mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {We use our sense of time to identify temporal relationships between events and to anticipate actions. The degree to which we can exploit temporal contingencies depends on the variability of our measurements of time. We asked humans to reproduce time intervals drawn from different underlying distributions. As expected, production times were more variable for longer intervals. However, production times exhibited a systematic regression toward the mean. Consequently, estimates for a sample interval differed depending on the distribution from which it was drawn. A performance-optimizing Bayesian model that takes the underlying distribution of samples into account provided an accurate description of subjects' performance, variability and bias. This finding suggests that the CNS incorporates knowledge about temporal uncertainty to adapt internal timing mechanisms to the temporal statistics of the environment.},

	Abstract = {We used an appetitive sensory preconditioning procedure to investigate temporal integration in rats in two experiments. In Phase 1, rats were presented with simultaneous compound trials on which a 10-sec conditioned stimulus (CS) X was embedded within a 60-sec CS A. In Group Early, CS X occurred during the early portion of CS A, whereas in Group Late, CS X occurred during the latter portion of CS A. In Phase 2, CS X was paired simultaneously with sucrose. On a subsequent test with CS A, the rate of magazine entries peaked during the early portions of the stimulus in Group Early and during the latter portions of the stimulus in Group Late (Experiments 1 and 2). Similar response peaks were not observed on tests with a control stimulus that had been presented in compound with a stimulus that did not signal reward (Experiment 2).},

	Abstract = {Working memory capacity (WMC) predicts individual differences in a wide range of mental abilities. In three experiments we examined whether WMC would predict temporal judgment. Low-WMC temporal reproductions were consistently too long for the shortest duration and too short for the longest, but were accurate (unbiased) for the intermediate. In contrast, high-WMC temporal reproductions were more accurate (unbiased) across the range. Thus low-WMC showed a classic "migration effect" (Vierordt's Law) to a greater extent than high-WMC. Furthermore reproduction errors depended more on temporal context than the absolute durations of "shortest," "longest," and "intermediate." Low-WMC reproductions were overall more variable than high-WMC. General fluid intelligence (gF) was also related to temporal bias and variability. However, WMC-related timing differences were only attenuated and not eliminated with gF as covariate. Results are discussed in terms of attention, memory, and other psychological constructs.},

	Abstract = {Two experiments studied normal humans in an analogue of the time-left procedure of J. Gibbon and R. M. Church (1981). In Experiment 1 the "standard" alternative (S) was always half the length of the "comparison" time-left link (C), and S ranged from 4 to 8 s. Humans showed an increasing preference for the time-left alternative with increasing elapsed time in the interval, and indifference points strongly supported the idea of a linear, rather than a logarithmic, time scale. Experiment 2 used some conditions in which S was greater or less than C/2, and preference for the time-left alternative varied systematically with the S/C ratio. Data from both experiments showed reasonable superposition, suggesting underlying scalar timing processes in time left in humans.},

	Abstract = {Some authors have suggested separate mechanisms for the processing of temporal intervals above versus below 2-3s. Given that the evidence is mixed, the present experiment was carried out as a critical test of the separate-mechanism hypothesis. Subjects reproduced five standard durations of 1-5s presented in the auditory and visual modalities. The Corsi-block test was used to assess effects of working-memory span on different interval lengths. Greater working-memory span was associated with longer reproductions of intervals of 3-5s. A factor analysis run on mean reproduced intervals revealed one modality-unspecific factor for durations of 1-2s and two modality-specific factors for longer intervals. These results are interpreted as further indications that two different processes underlie temporal reproductions of shorter and longer intervals.},

	Abstract = {Remembering experiences that lead to reward is essential for survival. The hippocampus is required for forming and storing memories of events and places, but the mechanisms that associate specific experiences with rewarding outcomes are not understood. Event memory storage is thought to depend on the reactivation of previous experiences during hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs). We used a sequence switching task that allowed us to examine the interaction between SWRs and reward. We compared SWR activity after animals traversed spatial trajectories and either received or did not receive a reward. Here, we show that rat hippocampal CA3 principal cells are significantly more active during SWRs following receipt of reward. This SWR activity was further enhanced during learning and reactivated coherent elements of the paths associated with the reward location. This enhanced reactivation in response to reward could be a mechanism to bind rewarding outcomes to the experiences that precede them.},

In joint multineuron recordings from these areas, hippocampal-striatal ensembles reactivated together during sleep. This process was especially strong in pairs in which the hippocampal cell processed spatial information and ventral striatal firing correlated to reward. Replay was dominated by cell pairs in which the hippocampal "place" cell fired preferentially before the striatal reward-related neuron. Our results suggest a plausible mechanism for consolidating place-reward associations and are consistent with a central tenet of consolidation theory, showing that the hippocampus leads reactivation in a projection area.},

	Abstract = {Hippocampal replay is thought to be essential for the consolidation of event memories in hippocampal-neocortical networks. Replay is present during both sleep and waking behavior, but although sleep replay involves the reactivation of stored representations in the absence of specific sensory inputs, awake replay is thought to depend on sensory input from the current environment. Here, we show that stored representations are reactivated during both waking and sleep replay. We found frequent awake replay of sequences of rat hippocampal place cells from a previous experience. This spatially remote replay was as common as local replay of the current environment and was more robust when the rat had recently been in motion than during extended periods of quiescence. Our results indicate that the hippocampus consistently replays past experiences during brief pauses in waking behavior, suggesting a role for waking replay in memory consolidation and retrieval.},

	Abstract = {The hippocampus in the mammalian brain is required for the encoding of current and the retention of past experience. Previous studies have shown that the hippocampus contains neurons that encode information required to perform spatial and nonspatial short-term memory tasks. A more detailed understanding of the functional anatomy of the hippocampus would provide important insight into how such encoding occurs. Here we show that hippocampal neurons in the rat are distributed anatomically in distinct segments along the length of the hippocampus. Each longitudinal segment contains clusters of neurons that become active when the animal performs a task with spatial attributes. Within these same segments are ordered arrangements of neurons that encode the nonspatial aspects of the task appropriate to those spatial features. Thus, anatomical segregation of spatial information, together with the interleaved representation of nonspatial information, represents a structural framework that may help to resolve conflicting views of hippocampal function.},

	Abstract = {Phase-amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between theta (4-12 Hz) and gamma (30-100 Hz) oscillations occurs frequently in the hippocampus. However, it still remains unclear whether theta-gamma coupling has any functional significance. To address this issue, we studied CFC in local field potential oscillations recorded from the CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus of rats as they learned to associate items with their spatial context. During the course of learning, the amplitude of the low gamma subband (30-60 Hz) became more strongly modulated by theta phase in CA3, and higher levels of theta-gamma modulation were maintained throughout overtraining sessions. Furthermore, the strength of theta-gamma coupling was directly correlated with the increase in performance accuracy during learning sessions. These findings suggest a role for hippocampal theta-gamma coupling in memory recall.},

However, studies to date have not provided compelling evidence that hippocampal neurons encode event-context conjunctions directly associated with this kind of learning. Here we report that, as animals learn different meanings for items in distinct contexts, individual hippocampal neurons develop responses to specific stimuli in the places where they have differential significance. Furthermore, this conjunctive coding evolves in the form of enhanced item-specific responses within a subset of the preexisting spatial representation. These findings support the view that conjunctive representations in the hippocampus underlie the acquisition of context-specific memories.},

  A-B pair, subjects can recall A given B as well as they can recall B given A
  (Kahana, 2002). To assess whether this symmetry property is unique to pairs,
  we investigated the effects of study direction on probed recall of word
  triples and serial lists. Two experiments revealed a forward-recall
  advantage in both triples and serial lists. In addition, compound cues
  produced better recall than did single-item adjacent cues, which, in turn,
  produced better recall than did remote cues. These findings suggest a
  discontinuity between the associative processes supporting memory for pairs

  opposing views of episodic association. The independent association
  hypothesis (IAH) sees associations as unidirectional and separately
  modifiable links between individual item representations. The associative
  symmetry hypothesis (ASH) sees an association as a holistic conjunction of
  the constituent items, blending the elements of their representations into a
  new one. In early tests of these hypotheses, experimenters compared forward
  and backward recall of paired associates, looking for asymmetries. Although
  some studies showed significant differences between forward and backward
  recall, the vast majority did not. The author of this study used a
  mathematical analysis of distributed memory models to reexamine this classic
  question. These analyses revealed that symmetric and asymmetric models can
  mimic each other, offering identical predictions regarding forward and
  backward recall. To distinguish these models, the author examined the
  correlation between forward and backward recall at the level of individual
pairs of items. Both this correlation and the correlation between recall of
pairs tested in the same direction were near unity. These results provide new
evidence favoring the ASH over the IAH.},

manipulation was that it allowed us to examine, using two groups that differ
significantly in their learning ability, whether organization and learning
follow the same function.  As was expected, older adults showed less
organization on any given learning trial.  However, when equated for degree of
learning, the older adults showed approximately the same level of organization

The derivation of these regularities from attention/likelihood theory is demonstrated. The theory's central concept, which distinguishes it from other theories, is the following: Ss make recognition decisions by combining information about new and old items, the combination made in the form of likelihood ratios. The central role of the likelihood ratios extends the implications of signal detection theory for recognition memory. Attention/likelihood theory is fitted to data of 2 series of experiments. One series involves yes-no tests and confidence ratings, the other forced-choice experiments. It is argued that the regularities require a revision of most current theories of recognition memory.},

The data demonstrate 3 regularities: convex ROCs, z-ROCs with linear slopes of 1.00, and slightly concave z-ROCs. Two of these regularities support the model. The 3rd requires a revision of the model. This revised model is fitted to the data. The implications of these regularities for other theories are also discussed.},

previously learned responses. Recovery of such responses with the aid of a
prompter is conceived to involve an independent retrieval and recognition
process. These subprocesses are measured independently and predictions of
prompted recall success are generated for prompters of varying strength and
for various retention intervals. The predictions are evaluated by observing
prompted recall success and the data produce a good fit under a variety of
experimental conditions. Residual errors are related to possible modifications
of the model. The prompted recall situation is well suited for component
analysis of memory because it permits isolated study of various aspects of
retrieval. ((c) 1999 APA/PsycINFO, all rights reserved) . },

associations are formed, and whether or not associations are formed between
items spatially remote in the series. 73 college students acted as S's in 4
different experiments. They learned lists of 10 or 16 2-syllable adjectives,
or consonant syllables (Witmer's), by the anticipation method. After this E
presented orally random words from the lists, and asked S to report the first
word that came to mind. The results show that there is a recall of a large
number of items removed from the stimulus word by one or more intervening
serial positions. About 30\% on the average are backward associations.
Associations coming from outside the list have longer reaction times than
those coming from the list. Words of all degrees of remoteness from the
stimulus word are given in decreasing frequency from the zero position, but
the reaction times of the more remote associations do not differ significantly
from those in the zero position. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2000 APA, all

	Abstract = {This study deals with the relationship between STM and PA learning. The first three experiments were an attempt to determine if traditional variables of PA learning had the expected effect on STM for individual pairs. The general procedure was such that a list of pairs composed of common English words paired at random was presented once with a presentation time of 2 sec. per pair; then, one of the pairs was tested for recall.

In Exp. I lists were two, three, four, or five pairs long. In Exp. II presentation time was 1, 2, or 3 sec. per pair. In Exp. III one, two, or three presentations of each list preceded the recall test. Results suggested that the retention curve leveled out after approximately two subsequent pairs at a value which increased with presentation time, number of presentations, and, possibly, shorter lists.

Experiment IV was essentially the first trial of a PA learning task; all pairs were tested for recall and lists were 8, 16, 24, or 32 pairs long. As predicted, number of words recalled increased with list length. Also, during the first block of eight recalls, recall probability for the 8 pair list was higher than for the 16-, 24-, and 32-pair lists; the latter three lengths did not differ.

In general the results lent support to the notion that there might be marked intratrial learning and forgetting of individual pairs during PA learning, that some of the phenomena of PA learning might be predictable from studies of STM, and the PA ``learning'' might basically be increased resistance to intertrial forgetting.},

			      the hippocampus, amygdala and parahippocampal
			      gyrus, are severely impaired in their ability to
			      remember and recognize words or faces which they
			      saw only a short time ago. These lesions also
			      prevent the effect of word repetition on
			      cortical event-related potentials that are
			      associated with these tasks. We have been able
			      to study the response of individual neurons in
			      the human medial temporal lobe to such delayed
			      recognition tasks in epileptic patients
undergoing neurosurgery. We found that some MTL neurons preferentially fired
on sight of one particular word from a set of ten words used in a memory task,
   and others fired in response to one particular face. This stimulus-specific
   firing was maximal during the time that the neocortical event potentials
   are most sensitive to stimulus repetition, suggesting that the MTL
   contributes specific information to the cortex during the retrieval of
   recent memories.},

	Annote = {The claim that recognition memory is spared relative to recall after focal hippocampal damage has been disputed in the literature. We examined this claim by investigating object and object-location recall and recognition memory in a patient, YR, who has adult-onset selective hippocampal damage. Our aim was to identify the conditions under which recognition was spared relative to recall in this patient. She showed unimpaired forced-choice object recognition but clearly impaired recall, even when her control subjects found the object recognition task to be numerically harder than the object recall task. However, on two other recognition tests, YR's performance was not relatively spared. First, she was clearly impaired at an equivalently difficult yes/no object recognition task, but only when targets and foils were very similar. Second, YR was clearly impaired at forced-choice recognition of object-location associations. This impairment was also unrelated to difficulty because this task was no more difficult than the forced-choice object recognition task for control subjects. The clear impairment of yes/no, but not of forced-choice, object recognition after focal hippocampal damage, when targets and foils are very similar, is predicted by the neural network-based Complementary Learning Systems model of recognition. This model postulates that recognition is mediated by hippocampally dependent recollection and cortically dependent familiarity; thus hippocampal damage should not impair item familiarity. The model postulates that familiarity is ineffective when very similar targets and foils are shown one at a time and subjects have to identify which items are old (yes/no recognition). In contrast, familiarity is effective in discriminating which of similar targets and foils, seen together, is old (forced-choice recognition). Independent evidence from the remember/know procedure also indicates that YR's familiarity is normal. The Complementary Learning Systems model can also accommodate the clear impairment of forced-choice object-location recognition memory if it incorporates the view that the most complete convergence of spatial and object information, represented in different cortical regions, occurs in the hippocampus.},

rapidly decreasing initial portion of the retention curve with multiple paired

time. The later portion of the short-term retention curve is considered to
reflect largely an associative mechanism which may produce stronger

hippocampus is specialized for spatial memory or whether it mediates a general
memory function, as it does in humans.  To address this issue we trained
normal rats and rats with hippocampal damage on non-spatial stimulus-stimulus
associations, then probed the nature of their memory representations.  We
report here that normal rats demonstrated two forms of flexible memory
expression, transitivity, the ability to judge inferentially across stimulus
pairs that share a common element, and symmetry, the ability to associate
paired elements presented in the reverse of training order.  Rats with
neurotoxic damage limited to the hippocampus demonstrated neither form of
flexible expression, indicating that non-spatial declarative processing
depends specifically on the hippocampus in animals as it does in humans.},

associations were investigated in two experiments.  In both experiments
subjects first studied unrelated word pairs.  At test, they were presented
with old words in the same pairing as at study (same pairs), old words in a
different pairing from study (rearranged pairs), and pairs of new words.  In
Experiment 1 the test requirement was to discriminate between old and new
pairs and, for any pair judged old, to then judge whether the pair was the
same or rearranged.  In Experiment 2 the requirement was merely to
discriminate between old and new pairs.  Event-related potentials (ERPs) were
recorded for correctly classified same, rearranged and new pairs.  The ERPs
elicited by same pairs exhibited a similar pattern of effects in both
experiments.  Relative to the ERPs to new pairs, these effects took the form
of sustained positive shifts with two distinct scalp maxima, over the left
temporo-parietal and right frontal scalp respectively.  ERPs to rearranged
pairs showed effects which were similar in scalp topography, but markedly
smaller in magnitude.  This pattern of ERP effects closely resembles that
found previously for test items defined as recollected on the basis of their
attracting a successful source judgement.  The findings therefore suggest that
associative recognition memory shares some of the recollective processes that
are engaged by the requirement to retrieve contextual information about a
study episode.  The findings from Experiment 2 indicate that the processes
associated with the recollection of associated pairs are engaged regardless of
whether the retrieval of associative information is an explicit task
requirement.},

Here we use scalp-recorded event-related brain potentials to identify neural
activity associated with implicit and explicit memory during the performance
of a recognition memory task.  Relative to new words, recently studied words
produced activity in three neuroanatomically and functionally dissociable
neural populations.  One of these populations was activated whether or not the
word was consciously recognized, and its activity therefore represents a
neural correlate of implicit memory.  Thus, when task and memory contamination
effects are eliminated, the neural correlates of explicit and implicit memory
differ qualitatively.},

	Annote = {Free recall and recognition are simulated in a network model of the
hippocampal formation, incorporating simplified simulations of neurons,
synaptic connections, and the effects of acetylcholine.  Simulations focus on
modeling the effects of the acetylcholine receptor blocker scopolamine on
human memory.  Systemic administration of scopolamine is modeled by blockade
of the cellular effects of acetylcholine in the model, resulting in memory
impairments replicating data from studies on human subjects.  This blockade of
cholinergic effects impairs the encoding of new input patterns (as measured by
delayed free recall), but does not impair the delayed free recall of input
patterns learned before the blockade.  The impairment is selective to the free
recall but not the recognition of items encoded under the influence of
scopolamine.  In the model, scopolamine blocks strengthening of recurrent
connections in region CA3 to form attractor states for new items (encoding
impaired) but allows recurrent excitation to drive the network into previously
stored attractor states (retrieval spared).  Neuron populations representing
items (individual words) have weaker recurrent connections than neuron
populations representing experimental context.  When scopolamine further
weakens the strength of recurrent connections it selectively prevents the
subsequent reactivation of item attractor states by context input (impaired
free recall) without impairing the subsequent reactivation of context
attractor states by item input (spared recognition).  This asymmetry in the
strength of attractor states also allows simulation of the list-strength
effect for free recall but not recognition.  Simulation of a paired associate
learning paradigm predicts that scopolamine should greatly enhance proactive
interference due to retrieval of previously encoded associations during
storage of new associations.},

associative interference during learning (M. E. Hasselmo, B. P. Anderson, \& J.

behavioral evidence supporting this hypothesis. A simultaneous discrimination
task required learning a baseline odor pair (A+B-) and then, under the
influence of scopolamine, a novel odor pair (A-C+) with an overlapping
component (A) versus a novel odor pair (D+E-) with no overlapping component. As
predicted by the model, rats that received scopolamine (0.50 and 0.25 mg/kg)
were more impaired at acquiring overlapping than nonoverlapping odor pairs
relative to their performance under normal saline or methylscopolamine. These
results support the prediction that the physiological effects of acetylcholine
can reduce interference between stored odor memories during associative
learning. },

	Annote = {Using the techniques set out in the preceding paper
                     (Muller et al., 1987), we investigated the
                     response of place cells to changes in the
                     animal's environment. The standard apparatus used
                     was a cylinder, 76 cm in diameter, with walls 51
                     cm high. The interior was uniformly gray except
                     for a white cue card that ran the full height of
                     the wall and occupied 100 degrees of arc. The
                     floor of the apparatus presented no obstacles to
                     the animal's motions. Each of these major
                     features of the apparatus was varied while the
                     others were held constant. One set of
                     manipulations involved the cue card. Rotating the
                     cue card produced equal rotations of the firing
                     fields of single cells. Changing the width of the
                     card did not affect the size, shape, or radial
                     position of firing fields, although sometimes the
                     field rotated to a modest extent. Removing the
                     cue card altogether also left the size, shape,
                     and radial positions of firing fields unchanged,
                     but caused fields to rotate to unpredictable
                     angular positions. The second set of
                     manipulations dealt with the size and shape of
                     the apparatus wall.  When the standard (small)
                     cylinder was scaled up in diameter and height by
                     a factor of 2, the firing fields of 36% of the
                     cells observed in both cylinders also scaled, in
                     the sense that the field stayed at the same
                     angular position and at the same relative radial
                     position. Of the cells recorded in both
                     cylinders, 52% showed very different firing
                     patterns in one cylinder than in the other. The
                     remaining 12% of the cells were virtually silent
                     in both cylinders. Similar results were obtained
                     when individual cells were recorded in both a
                     small and a large rectangular enclosure. By
                     contrast, when the apparatus floor plan was
                     changed from circular to rectangular, the firing
                     pattern of a cell in an apparatus of one shape
                     could not be predicted from a knowledge of the
                     firing pattern in the other shape. The final
                     manipulations involved placing vertical barriers
                     into the otherwise unobstructed floor of the
                     small cylinder. When an opaque barrier was set up
                     to bisect a previously recorded firing field, in
                     almost all cases the firing field was nearly
                     abolished. This was true even though the barrier
                     occupied only a small fraction of the firing
                     field area. A transparent barrier was effective
                     as the opaque barrier in attenuating firing
                     fields. The lead base used to anchor the vertical
                     barriers did not affect place cell firing.},

	Annote = {Hippocampal place cells fire when a freely
                     moving rat is in a given location. The firing of
                     these cells is controlled by visual and nonvisual
                     environmental cues. The effects of darkness on
                     the firing of place cells was studied using the
                     task of Muller et al. (1987), in which rats were
                     trained to chase randomly scattered food pellets
                     in a cylindrical drum with a white cue-card
                     attached to the wall. The position of the rats
                     was tracked via an infrared LED on the headstage
                     with a video system linked to computer. Two
                     experimental protocols were used: in the first,
                     lights were turned off after the rat had already
                     been placed in the chamber; in the second, the
                     rat was placed in the darkened chamber. The dark
                     segments produced by these 2 methods were
                     identical with respect to light and other cues
                     but differed with respect to the rat's
                     experience. The firing patterns of 24 of 28 cells
                     were unaffected by darkness when it was preceded
                     by a light period. In contrast, the firing
                     patterns of 14 of 22 cells changed dramatically
                     when the rats were put into the darkened chamber.
                     Furthermore, the majority of cells that changed
                     their firing pattern in initial darkness
                     maintained that change when the lights were
                     turned on. These results show that place cells
                     can fire differently in identical cue situations
                     and that the best predictor of firing pattern is
                     a combination of current cues and the rat's
                     recent experience. The results are discussed in
                     terms of mnemonic properties of hippocampal cells
                     and remapping of place cell representations.},

                     non-phase-locked episodes of synchronization in
                     the gamma-band (30-60 Hz). One of their putative
                     roles in the visual modality is
                     feature-binding. We tested the stimulus
                     specificity of high-frequency oscillations in
                     humans using three types of visual stimuli: two
                     coherent stimuli (a Kanizsa and a real triangle)
                     and a noncoherent stimulus (no-triangle
                     stimulus). The task of the subject was to count
                     the occurrences of a curved illusory triangle. A
                     time-frequency analysis of single-trial EEG data
                     recorded from eight human subjects was performed
                     to characterize phase-locked as well as
                     non-phase-locked high-frequency activities. We
                     found in early phase-locked 40 Hz component,
                     maximal at electrodes Cz-C4, which does not vary
                     with stimulation type. We describe a second 40 Hz
                     component, appearing around 280 msec, that is not
                     phase-locked to stimulus onset. This component is
                     stronger in response to a coherent triangle,
                     whether real or illusory: it could reflect,
                     therefore, a mechanism of feature binding based
                     on high-frequency synchronization. Because both
                     the illusory and the real triangle are more
                     target-like, it could also correspond to an
                     oscillatory mechanism for testing the match
                     between stimulus and target. At the same
                     latencies, the low-frequency evoked response
                     components phase-locked to stimulus onset behave
                     differently, suggesting that low- and
                     high-frequency activities have different
                     functional roles.},

                     by the synchronization in the gamma-band (30-70
                     Hz) of a distributed neuronal assembly. Here we
                     measure variations of high-frequency activity on
                     the human scalp. The experiment is designed to
                     allow the comparison of two different perceptions
                     of the same picture. In the first condition, an
                     apparently meaningless picture that contained a
                     hidden Dalmatian, a neutral stimulus, and a
                     target stimulus (twirled blobs) are
                     presented. After the subject has been trained to
                     perceive the hidden dog and its mirror image, the
                     second part of the recordings is performed
                     (condition 2). The same neutral stimulus is
                     presented, intermixed with the picture of the dog
                     and its mirror image (target stimulus). Early (95
                     msec) phase-locked (or stimulus-locked)
                     gamma-band oscillations do not vary with stimulus
                     type but can be subdivided into an anterior
                     component (38 Hz) and a posterior component (35
                     Hz). Nonphase-locked gamma-band oscillations
                     appear with a latency jitter around 280 msec
                     after stimulus onset and disappear in averaged
                     data. They increase in amplitude in response to
                     both target stimuli. They also globally increase
                     in the second condition compared with the first
                     one. It is suggested that this gamma-band energy

                     assembly coding for the Dalmatian. The

                     components of the response are discussed, and a
                     possible functional role of each component is

                     distributed cell assembly synchronized on an
                     oscillatory mode in the gamma-band (20-80 Hz). If
                     this hypothesis is correct, then oscillatory
                     gamma-band activity should appear in any task
                     requiring the activation of an object
                     representation, and in particular when an object
                     representation is held active in short-term
                     memory: sustained gamma-band activity is thus
                     expected during the delay of a
                     delayed-matching-to-sample task. EEG was recorded
                     while subjects performed such a task. Induced
                     (e. g., appearing with a jitter in latency from
                     one trial to the next) gamma-band activity was
                     observed during the delay. In a control task, in
                     which no memorization was required, this activity
                     disappeared. Furthermore, this gamma-band
                     activity during the rehearsal of the first
                     stimulus representation in short-term memory
                     peaked at both occipitotemporal and frontal
                     electrodes. This topography fits with the idea of
                     a synchronized cortical network centered on
                     prefrontal and ventral visual areas. Activities
                     in the alpha band, in the 15-20 Hz band, and in
                     the averaged evoked potential were also
                     analyzed. The gamma-band activity during the
                     delay can be distinguished from all of these
                     other components of the response, on the basis of
                     either its variations or its topography. It thus

                     potentials. Sustained activities (lasting until
                     the end of the delay) are more likely to reflect
                     the continuous rehearsing process in memory than
                     transient (ending before the end of the delay)
                     activities.  Nevertheless, since the delay
                     duration we used in our previous experiment was
                     fixed and rather short, it was difficult to
                     discriminate between sustained and transient
                     components. Here we used the same delayed
                     matching-to-sample task, but with variable delay
                     durations. The same oscillatory components in the
                     gamma and beta bands were observed again during
                     the delay. The only components that showed a
                     sustained time course compatible with a memory
                     rehearsing process were the occipital gamma and
                     frontal beta induced activities. These two
                     activities slowly decreased with increasing delay
                     duration, while the performance of the subjects
                     decreased in parallel. No sustained response
                     could be found in the evoked potentials. These
                     results support the hypothesis that objects
                     representations in visual short-term memory
                     consist of oscillating synchronized cell
                     assemblies.},

@article{AndeBowe72,
	Annote = {Describes a model of free recall which identifies 2 processes: (a)
retrieval, by which S accesses the words; and (b) recognition, by which S
decides whether an implicitly retrieved word is a to-be-recalled word.
Submodels for the recognition and retrieval processes are described. The
recognition model assumes that during the study phase, S associates `list
markers' to the to-be-recalled words. The establishment of such associates is
postulated to be an all-or-none stochastic process. In the test phase, S
recognizes to-be-recalled words by deciding which words have relevant list
markers as associates. A signal detectability model is developed for this
decision process. The retrieval model is introduced as a computer program that
tags associative paths between list words. In 4 experiments, 41 male and 52
female 16-32 yr. old Ss studied and were tested on a sequence of overlapping
sublists sampled from a master set of common nouns. Results confirm the
prediction that S's ability to retrieve the words would increase as more
overlapping sublists were studied, but his ability to differentiate the words
on the most recent list should deteriorate.  Further predictions derived from
the free recall model were also supported. (56 ref.) ((c) 1999 APA/PsycINFO,

configuration of the traversable space, motor behavior (e. g., linear and
angular velocities), and behavioral context (e. g., presence of specific,
consistent goal locations within the environment).  The contributions of these
factors to spatial and directional tuning of hippocampal neurons was
systematically examined in rats performing several tasks in either an enriched

more spatially and directionally selective on a radial maze than on an open,
circular platform, regardless of the visual environment.  On the platform,
fields were more directional when the rat searched for food at fixed
locations, in a stereotypic and directed manner, than when the food was
scattered randomly.  Thus, it seems that place fields are more directional
when the animal is planning or following a route between points of special
significance.  This might be related to the spatial focus of the rat's
attention (e. g., a particular reference point).  Changing the behavioral task
was also accompanied by a change in firing location in about one-third of the

their directionality tends to get stronger in radial-arm mazes.  We also find

different forms of memory, responses of entorhinal cells were recorded as
monkeys performed either an object or place memory task.  The object memory
task was a variation of delayed matching to sample.  A sample picture was
presented at the start of the trial, followed by a variable sequence of zero
to four test pictures, ending with a repetition of the sample (i. e., a match).
The place memory task was a variation of delayed matching to place.  In this
task, a cue stimulus was presented at a variable sequence of one to four
`places' on a computer screen, ending with a repetition of one of the
previously shown places (i. e., a match).  For both tasks, the animals were
rewarded for releasing a bar to the match.  To solve these tasks, the monkey
must 1) discriminate the stimuli, 2) maintain a memory of the appropriate
stimuli during the course of the trial, and 3) evaluate whether a test
stimulus matches previously presented stimuli.  The responses of entorhinal
cortex neurons were consistent with a role in all three of these processes in
both tasks.  We found that 47% and 55% of the visually responsive entorhinal
cells responded selectively to the different objects or places presented
during the object or place task, respectively.  Similar to previous findings
in prefrontal but not perirhinal cortex on the object task, some entorhinal
cells had sample-specific delay activity that was maintained throughout all of
the delay intervals in the sequence.  For the place task, some cells had
location-specific maintained activity in the delay immediately following a
specific cue location.  In addition, 59% and 22% of the visually responsive
cells recorded during the object and place task, respectively, responded
differently to the test stimuli according to whether they were matching or
non-matching to the stimuli held in memory.  Responses of some cells were
enhanced to matching stimuli, whereas others were suppressed.  This
suppression or enhancement typically occurred well before the animals'
behavioral response, suggesting that this information could be used to perform
the task.  These results indicate that entorhinal cells receive sensory

carries information about objects and locations held in short-term memory.},

evidence supporting the view that the hippocampus is dedicated to spatial
processing.  However, most studies demonstrating the spatial properties of
hippocampal unit activity have employed tasks that emphasize spatial cues but
minimize nonspatial cues. In the present experiment we recorded the activity
of hippocampal complex-spike cells from rats performing a nonspatial radial
maze task. Performance in this task was guided by local visual-tactile cues on
the maze arms, while distal spatial cues were minimized and made irrelevant.
The influence of three variables on unit activity was examined:type of cue on
an arm, spatial location of an arm, and the relative position of the animal on
an arm. Of the units recorded, almost one-fifth were classified as `cue cells'
in that their activity was associated with cue type but not spatial location.
Conversely, a similar proportion of the units were classified as `place cells'
in that their activity was associated with location, but not cue type. In an
additional similar proportion of units, firing was influenced only by relative
position and not by local cues or spatial locations. For the majority of
units, however, firing was related to combinations of these three variables,
indicating that most hippocampal neurons encoded conjunctions or relations
between spatial and local cue information. This pattern of results indicates
that when local rather than distal spatial cues are emphasized, hippocampal
neural activity is strongly influenced by salient nonspatial cues and shows no
overwhelming predominance of place coding. These findings are at odds with the
hypothesis that the hippocampus is selectively involved in spatial processing
and, conversely, support the broader view that the hippocampus encodes both
spatial and nonspatial relations among important experimental variables. },

increased WM load.  These results suggest that WM emerges from the formation
of a dynamic cortical network linking task-specific processes with
non-specific, capacity-limited, higher-order attentional processes.  Practice

distributed network in the absence of visual input?  Hebb's influential but so
far unproved proposal, developed more than 50 years ago, is that sustained
activation in short-term memory networks is maintained by reverberating
activity in neuronal loops.  We hypothesized that synchronized oscillatory
activity, proposed to provide a dynamic link between distributed areas, could
not only coordinate activity in the network but also establish reentrant loops
in the system to enable both sustained firing and temporal coincidence of
inputs.  We show in human intracranial recordings that limited regions of
extrastriate visual areas, separated by several centimeters, become
synchronized in an oscillatory mode during the rehearsal of an object in
visual short-term memory.  Synchrony occurs specifically in the beta range
(15-25 Hz) and disappears in a control condition.  These findings thus confirm
experimentally the hypothesis of a functional role of synchronized oscillatory
activity in the coordination of distributed neural activity in humans, and
support Hebb's popular but unproved concept of short-term memory maintenance

Using single and multiunit recordings in the striate cortex of alert macaque
monkeys, we find that gamma-band (20-70 Hz) oscillations in neuronal firing
are a prominent feature of V1 neuronal activity.  The properties of this
rhythmic activity are very similar to those previously observed in the cat.
Gamma-band activity is strongly dependent on visual stimulation, largely
absent during spontaneous activity and, under the conditions of our
experiment, not time-locked to the vertical refresh of the computer monitor
(80 Hz) used to present the stimuli.  In our sample, 61% of multiunit activity
(MUA) and 46% of single-unit activity (SUA) was significantly oscillatory,
with mean frequencies of 48+/-9 and 42+/-13 Hz, respectively.  Gamma-band
activity was most likely to occur when cells were activated by their optimal
stimuli, but still occurred, although less often and with lower amplitude, in
response to nonoptimal stimuli.  The frequency of gamma-band activity also
reflected stimulus properties, with drifting gratings evoking higher-frequency
oscillations than stationary gratings.  As in the cat, the spike trains of
single cells showing gamma-band oscillations often displayed a pattern of
repetitive burst firing, with intraburst firing rates of 300-800 Hz.  The
overall similarity of rhythmic neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex
of cats and monkeys suggests that the phenomenon is not species-specific.  The
stimulus-dependence of the rhythmic activity is consistent with a functional
role in visual perception.},

Neuronal response synchronization with millisecond precision has been proposed
to serve feature binding in vision and should therefore, like visual
experience, depend on central states. Here we test this hypothesis by
examining the occurrence and strength of response synchronization in areas 17
and 18 of anesthetized cats as a function of central states. These were
assessed from the frequency content of the electroencephalogram, low power in
the and high power in the  frequency ranges (here 20-70 Hz) being considered
as a signature of activated states. We evaluated both spontaneous state
changes and transitions induced by electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic
reticular formation. During states of low central activation, visual responses
were robust but lacked signs of precise synchronization. At intermediate
levels of activation, responses became synchronized and exhibited an
oscillatory patterning in the range of 70-105 Hz. At higher levels of
activation, a different pattern of response synchronization and oscillatory
modulation appeared, oscillation frequency now being in the range of 20-65 Hz.
The strength of response synchronization and oscillatory modulation in the
20-65 Hz range increased with further activation and was associated with a
decrease in oscillation frequency. We propose that the oscillatory patterning
in the 70-105 Hz range is attributable to oscillatory retinothalamic input and
that a minimal level of activation is necessary for cortical neurons to follow
this oscillatory pattern. In contrast, the synchronization of responses at
oscillation frequencies in the 20-65 Hz range appears to result from
intracortical synchronizing mechanisms, which become progressively more
effective as central activation increases. Surprisingly, enhanced
synchronization and oscillatory modulation in the frequency range were not
associated with consistent increases in response amplitude, excluding a simple
relation between central activation and neuronal discharge rate.  The fact
that intracortical synchronizing mechanisms are particularly effective during
states of central activation supports the hypothesis that precise
synchronization of responses plays a role in sensory processing. },

mind (working memory) and irrelevant information out of mind (behavioural
inhibition or interference resolution). Prefrontal cortex is essential for
working memory and for interference resolution, but it is unknown whether these
two mental abilities are mediated by common or distinct prefrontal regions. To
address this question, functional MRI was used to identify brain regions
activated by separate manipulations of working memory load and interference
within a single task (the Sternberg item recognition paradigm). Both load and
interference manipulations were associated with performance decrements.
Subjects were unaware of the interference manipulation. There was a high degree
of overlap between the regions activated by load and interference, which
included bilateral ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior
insula, anterior cingulate and parietal cortex. Critically, no region was
activated exclusively by interference. Several regions within this common
network exhibited a brain-behaviour correlation across subjects for the load or
interference manipulation. Activation within the right middle frontal gyrus and
left inferior frontal gyrus was correlated with the ability to resolve
interference efficiently, but not the ability to manage an increased working
memory load efficiently. Conversely, activation of the anterior cingulate was
correlated with load susceptibility, but was not correlated with interference
susceptibility. These findings suggest that, within the circuitry engaged by
this task, some regions are more critically involved in the resolution of
interference whereas others are more involved in the resolution of an increase
in load. The anterior cingulate was engaged to a greater extent by the load
than interference manipulation, suggesting that this region, which is thought
to be involved in detecting the need for greater allocation of attentional
resources, may be particularly implicated during awareness of the need for
cognitive control. In the present study, interference resolution did not
involve recruitment of additional inhibitory circuitry, but was instead
mediated by a subset of the neural system supporting working memory.},

massive backward projections ipsilaterally to the IT cortex.  We found that
the limbic lesion disrupted the associative code of the IT neurons between the
paired associates, without impairing the visual response to each stimulus.

the subject is then asked to retrieve the other pair member associated with
each cue.  Patients with lesions of the temporal lobe show marked impairment
in this test.  In our study, we trained monkeys in a pair-association task
using a set of computer-generated paired patterns.  We found two types of
task-related neurons in the anterior temporal cortex.  One type selectively
responded to both pictures of the paired associates.  The other type, which
had the strongest response to one picture during the cue presentation,
exhibited increasing activity during the delay period when the associate of
that picture was used as a cue.  These results provide new evidence that
single neurons acquire selectivity for visual patterns through associative
learning.  They also indicate neural mechanisms for storage and retrieval in
the long-term memory of paired associates.},

while rats traverse the stem of a T-maze in the spatial alternation task (Wood

disambiguate two odor sequences with overlapping elements. 
Two sequences, each consisting of six odors, were presented as a
series of discriminations between two odor cups (e. g., D1 being ``odor A'' Vs.
``odor X''; see figure). Preliminary results indicate that when the two
sequences are presented in alternation, hippocampal rats fail to disambiguate
the sequences when probed immediately after the overlapping elements (D5), but
perform normally at D6. In another version of the task in which the two
sequences are presented in random order, preliminary data indicate that
hippocampal rats are impaired on D5 when a delay of 30 minutes was introduced
between D4 and D5. These results suggest that sequence disambiguation is a

judgments can be based on the recollection of details about previous events or

models are examined, along with the methods that have been developed to
measure recollection and familiarity.  The relevant empirical literature from
behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging studies is then reviewed in
order to assess model predictions.  Results from a variety of measurement
methods, including task-dissociation and process-estimation methods, are found
to lead to remarkably consistent conclusions about the nature of recollection
and familiarity, particularly when ceiling effects are avoided.  For example,
recollection is found to be more sensitive than familiarity to response
speeding, division of attention, generation, semantic encoding, the effects of
aging, and the amnestic effects of benzodiazepines, but it is less sensitive
than familiarity to shifts in response criterion, fluency manipulations,
forgetting over short retention intervals, and some perceptual manipulations.
Moreover, neuropsychological and neuroimaging results indicate that the two
processes rely on partially distinct neural substrates and provide support for
models that assume that recollection relies on the hippocampus and prefrontal
cortex, whereas familiarity relies on regions surrounding the hippocampus.
Double dissociations produced by experimental manipulations at time of test
indicate that the two processes are independent at retrieval, and single
dissociations produced by study manipulations indicate that they are partially
independent during encoding.  Recollection is similar but not identical to
free recall, whereas familiarity is similar to conceptual implicit memory, but
is dissociable from perceptual implicit memory.  Finally, the results indicate
that recollection reflects a thresholdlike retrieval process that supports
novel learning, whereas familiarity reflects a signal-detection process that
can support novel learning only under certain conditions.  The results verify
a number of model predictions and prove useful in resolving several

profoundly excited by muscarine.  Thus, the cognition-enhancing effects of
muscarinic drugs in the MSDB cannot be attributed to an increase in
hippocampal ACh release.  Instead, disinhibitory mechanisms, caused by
increased impulse flow in the septohippocampal GABAergic pathway, may underlie
the cognition-enhancing effects of muscarinic agonists.  },

   value in that a common feature of anterograde amnesia is damage to part of
   an `extended hippocampal system' comprising the hippocampus, the fornix, the
   mamillary bodies, and the anterior thalamic nuclei. This view, which can be
   traced back to Delay and Brion (1969), differs from other recent models in
   placing critical importance on the efferents from the hippocampus via the
   fornix to the diencephalon. These are necessary for the encoding and, hence,
   the effective subsequent recall of episodic memory. An additional feature of
   this hippocampal-anterior thalamic axis is the presence of projections back
   from the diencephalon to the temporal cortex and hippocampus that also
   support episodic memory. In contrast, this hippocampal system is not
   required for tests of item recognition that primarily tax familiarity
   judgements. Familiarity judgements reflect an independent process that
   depends on a distinct system involving the perirhinal cortex of the temporal
   lobe and the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. In the large majority of

	Abstract = {In the early 1970s, Andersen and colleagues proposed that the
   principal excitatory pathways of the hippocampal formation were organized in
   a lamellar fashion. This proposition, based heavily on the physiological
   studies of the proponents, indicated that `a point source of entorhinal
   activity projects its impulses through the four membered pathway (of the
   hippocampal formation) along a slice or lamella, of hippocampal tissue
   oriented normally to the alvear surface' [Anderson P., Bliss V. P. and Skrede
   K. K. (1971) Expl Brain Res. 13, 222-238] and perpendicular to the long axis
   of the hippocampus. Andersen et al. further suggested that, ``By means of
   this lamellar organization, small strips of the hippocampal cortex may
   operate as independent functional units, although excitatory and inhibitory
   transverse connections may modify the behavior of neighboring lamellae.'' The
   `lamellar hypothesis' of hippocampal anatomical organization has had
   tremendous influence on the conceptualization of hippocampal information
   processing and was largely responsible for prompting the establishment of
   the in vitro hippocampal slice technology. While the `lamellar hypothesis'
   was consistent with the known neuroanatomy, subsequent neuroanatomical
   investigations, using a variety of modern tracing techniques, have
   invariably demonstrated that all of the major hippocampal projections,
   except for those arising from the granule cells of the dentate gyrus, are
   much more divergent than would be consistent with a strict interpretation of
   the lamellar hypothesis. This has become particularly clear in ongoing
   studies of the intrinsic hippocampal projections using the recently
   introduced anterograde tracer, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin. Citing
   the conclusions from several papers dealing with the anatomical organization
   of the hippocampal formation and using examples from recent Phaseolus
   vulgaris leucoagglutinin mapping studies, the following are demonstrated.
   (1) That the major hippocampal projections are as extensive and highly
   organized in the long or septotemporal axis of the hippocampus as in the
   transverse axis. (2) That at least some of the hippocampal projections, such
   as the associational projections arising from the dentate gyrus, appear to
   be specifically organized to integrate distant levels of the hippocampal
   formation. (3) That the physiological data of Anderson et al. can be re-
   interpreted in the light of these new anatomical data to show how the
   stimulation and recording protocols used at the time would, in fact,
   generate the appearance of a lamellar organization. It is concluded that it
   is heuristically most reasonable to consider the hippocampal formation as a
   three-dimensional cortical region with important information processing
   taking place in both the transverse and long axes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400

   Ant N project, in turn, to the prefrontal cortex, mainly to its ventral and

   two limbothalamic pathways also participate in memory functions, performance
   on a variety of learning and memory tasks was assessed in monkeys with
   lesions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (Group VM). Normal monkeys and
   monkeys with lesions of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Group DL) served as

   examine the acute dose-effects of scopolamine on false recognition. METHODS:
   The effects of subcutaneously administered scopolamine (0.3 and 0.6 mg/70

   paradigm were examined in a repeated-measures placebo-controlled

and induced a slow (4-7 Hz) theta rhythm. Unilateral or bilateral lesions
of the substantia innominata and ventral globus pallidus area using kainic
acid did not significantly change the cingulate EEG or its relation to
behavior. Large electrolytic lesions of the medial septal nuclei and
vertical limbs of the diagonal band generally decreased or abolished all
theta activity in the cingulate cortex and the hippocampus. However, in 5
rats the cingulate theta rhythm increased while the hippocampal theta
disappeared after a medial septal lesion. The large, postlesion cingulate
theta, accompanied by sharp EEG-spikes during its negative phase, is an
unequivocal demonstration of the existence of a theta rhythm in the
cingulate cortex, independent of the hippocampal rhythm. Cholinergic
afferents from the medial septum and diagonal band nuclei are inferred to
be responsible for the behavioral suppression of cingulate EEG-spikes and
ISA, and partially for the generation of a local cingulate theta rhythm.
However, an atropine-resistant pathway and a theta-suppressing pathway,
possibly coming from the medial septum or the hippocampus, may also be
important in cingulate theta generation.},

	Abstract = {Much data implicates the amygdala in the expression and
learning of fear. Yet, few studies have examined the neuronal correlates
of fear in the amygdala. This study aimed to determine whether fear is
correlated to particular activity patterns in the lateral amygdaloid (LA)
nucleus. Cats, chronically implanted with multiple microelectrodes in the
LA and a catheter in the femoral artery, learned that a series of tones
interrupted by a period of silence (5 sec) preceded the administration of
a footshock. During the silent period, their blood pressure increased,
indicating that they anticipated the noxious stimulus. In parallel, the
firing rate of LA neurons doubled, and the discharges of simultaneously
recorded cells became more synchronized. Moreover, cross- correlation of
focal LA waves revealed a significant increase in synchrony restricted to
the theta band. In keeping with this, perievent histograms of neuronal
discharges revealed rhythmic changes in the firing probability of LA
neurons in relation to focal theta waves. Finally, the responsiveness of
LA cells to the stimuli predicting the footshock (the tones) increased
during the trials, whereas responses to unrelated stimuli (perirhinal
shocks) remained stable. Thus, during the anticipation of noxious stimuli,
a state here defined anthropomorphically as fear, the firing rate of LA
neurons increases, and their discharges become more synchronized through a
modulation at the theta frequency. The presence of theta oscillations in
the LA might facilitate cooperative interactions between the amygdala and
cortical areas involved in memory.},

region's function in mediating stimulus representations. The theory assumes
that the hippocampal region develops new stimulus representations that enhance
the discriminability of differentially predictive cues while compressing the
representation of redundant cues. Other brain regions, including cerebral and
cerebellar cortices, are presumed to use these hippocampal representations to
recode their own stimulus representations. In the absence of an intact
hippocampal region, the theory implies that other brain regions will attempt to
learn associations using previously established fixed representations.
Instantiated as a connectionist network model, the theory provides a simple and
unified interpretation of the functional role of the hippocampal region in a
wide range of conditioning paradigms, including stimulus discrimination,
reversal learning, stimulus generalization, latent inhibition, sensory
preconditioning, and contextual sensitivity. The theory makes novel predictions
regarding the effects of hippocampal lesions on easy-hard transfer and compound
preexposure. Several prior qualitative characterizations of hippocampal
function--including stimulus selection, chunking, cue configuration, and
contextual coding--are identified as task-specific special cases derivable from
this more general theory. The theory suggests that a profitable direction for
future empirical and theoretical research will be the study of learning tasks
in which both intact and lesioned animals exhibit similar initial learning

stimulus constellation was scrambled, but often continued firing in the same
place when the stimulus was removed or switched to respond to other cues. When
the maze was surrounded by a new stimulus configuration, all of the cells
either developed new place fields or stopped firing, showing that the

Cohen and Howard Eichenbaum bring together converging findings from
neuropsychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science that provide the critical
clues and constraints for developing a more comprehensive understanding of
memory. Specifically, they offer a cognitive neuroscience theory of memory
that accounts for the nature of memory impairment exhibited in human amnesia
and animal models of amnesia, that specifies the functional role played by the
hippocampal system in memory, and that provides further understanding of the
componential structure of memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all

  cognitive mechanisms is consistent with key properties of declarative memory

  memories as sequences of events and the places, where they occur. In
  addition, hippocampal neuronal networks encode events and places that are

the construction of a 'memory space' composed of a network of linked episodic

  Several approaches to implementing backpropagation in a biologically
  plausible fashion converge on the idea of using bidirectional activation
  propagation in interactive networks to convey error signals. This article
  demonstrates two main points about these error-driven interactive networks:
  (1) they generalize poorly due to attractor dynamics that interfere with the
  network's ability to produce novel combinatorial representations
  systematically in response to novel inputs, and (2) this generalization
  problem can be remedied by adding two widely used mechanistic principles,
  inhibitory competition and Hebbian learning, that can be independently
  motivated for a variety of biological, psychological, and computational
reasons. Simulations using the Leabra algorithm, which combines the
generalized recirculation (GeneRec), biologically plausible, error-driven
learning algorithm with inhibitory competition and Hebbian learning, show that
these mechanisms can result in good generalization in interactive networks.

	Annote = {Using a two-spot tracking system that allowed measurements of the direction of a rat's head in the environment as well as the position of the rat's head, we investigated whether hippocampal place cells show true direction-specific as well as location-specific firing. Significant modulations of firing rate by head direction were seen for most cells while rats chased food pellets in a cylindrical apparatus. It was possible, however, to account quantitatively for directional modulation with a simple scheme that we refer to as the 'distributive hypothesis.' This hypothesis assumes that firing is ideally location specific, and that all directional firing modulations are due to differences in the time that the rat spends in different portions of the firing field of the place cell in different head direction sectors. When the distributive hypothesis is put into numeric form, the directional firing profiles that it predicts are extremely similar to the observed directional firing profiles, strongly suggesting that there is no intrinsic directional specificity of place cell firing in the cylinder. Additional recordings made while rats ran on an eight-arm maze reveal that many firing fields on the arms are polarized; the cell discharges more rapidly when the rat runs in one direction than the other on the maze. This result provides an independent confirmation of the findings of McNaughton et al. (1983). For fields that appear to be polarized by inspecting firing rate maps of the raw data, the magnitude of directional firing variations is greater than predicted by the distributive hypothesis. By comparison with postsubicular head direction cells, it is shown that the distributive prediction of weaker-than-observed directional firing is expected if there is a true directional firing component. A major conclusion reached from recording in both environments is that the directional firing properties of hippocampal place cells are variable and not fixed; this is true of individual units as well as of the population.},

In experiment 2, on a test of visual recognition memory (the visual paired comparison task) lesions of the perirhinal cortex impaired performance at long delays but spared performance at a very short delay. In contrast, lesions of area TE impaired performance even at the short delay. In experiment 3, lesions of the perirhinal cortex and lesions of area TE produced an opposite pattern of impairment on two visual discrimination tasks, simple object discrimination learning (impaired only by perirhinal lesions), and concurrent discrimination learning (impaired only by TE lesions).

Despite normal memory for such semantic knowledge acquired prior to the onset of his amnesia in 1953, H.M. showed a severe deficit in memory for semantic information encountered subsequently. In combination with the previously reported impairments in new learning shown by H.M., the deficits observed here point to an association between semantic and episodic memory, and do not lend support to a distinction between them. The acquisition of semantic and episodic information, therefore, appears to depend upon a common memory system that requires the intact functioning of medial temporal-lobe structures.},

In contrast, patient PS, who has a selective lesion of the hippocampus proper, has gained a sense of familiarity of novel vocabulary and famous people, even though her effortful retrieval of this new semantic knowledge remains impaired. These findings extend to amnesia of adult onset, the proposal of Vargha-Khadem and colleagues that in patients with selective hippocampal injury, cortical areas surrounding the hippocampus may play an important role in new semantic learning [Vargha-Khadem, F., Gadian, D.G., Watkins, K.

(whose lesion is limited mostly to the MTL, but who also has minimal damage to the anterolateral cortex). On 13 tests of semantic memory, patients with lesions limited to the hippocampal formation performed similarly to controls. Postencephalitic patients were mildly to moderately impaired on most tests. Patient H.M.'s performance was impaired on only a few tests and was less severely impaired overall than the three postencephalitic patients. A ranking of test scores showed a direct relationship between impairment and the extent of damage to lateral temporal cortex. These findings, and related findings from other studies, point to the importance of anterolateral temporal cortex for semantic knowledge. Patient H.M. performed uniquely in certain respects. For example, when providing definitions of objects, he made many grammatical errors. In contrast, the other patients with large MTL lesions made no more errors than those made by controls. Considering that H.M.'s lesion, both medially and laterally, is less extensive than the lesions in these other patients, it appears unlikely that his shortcomings in language production are related to his temporal lobe lesion.},

Data will be presented to counter both of these arguments. Results obtained from a series of 11 amnesic patients with a history of hypoxic ischaemic damage sustained perinatally or during childhood indicate that regardless of age at onset of hippocampal pathology, there is a pronounced dissociation between episodic memory, which is severely impaired, and semantic memory, which is relatively preserved. A second dissociation is characterized by markedly impaired recall and relatively spared recognition leading to a distinction between recollection-based versus familiarity-based judgements. These findings are discussed in terms of the locus and extent of neuropathology associated with hypoxic ischaemic damage, the neural basis of 'remembering' versus 'knowing', and a hierarchical model of cognitive memory.},

is devoted to a comprehensive treatment of the history and implications of the
notion of multiple memory systems, of the evidence that supports it, and of
the nature of the systems discovered thus far. Topics discussed include the
fundamentals of cellular plasticity, the critical role of the cerebral cortex
in memory, and a detailed analysis of the hippocampal memory system. The
authors also identify and describe the brain systems that mediate emotional
memories, that modulate memory, or that mediate the acquisition of behavioral
habits (procedural memories), all concerned with long-term memory abilities,
	and a system (in prefrontal cortex) that plays a special role in working
	memory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2002 APA, all rights reserved):

	Annote = {Working memory represents the ability of the brain to hold
  externally or internally driven information for relatively short periods of
  time. Persistent neuronal activity is the elementary process underlying
  working memory but its cellular basis remains unknown. The most widely
  accepted hypothesis is that persistent activity is based on synaptic
  reverberations in recurrent circuits. The entorhinal cortex in the
  parahippocampal region is crucially involved in the acquisition,
  consolidation and retrieval of long-term memory traces for which working
  memory operations are essential. Here we show that individual neurons from
  layer V of the entorhinal cortex-which link the hippocampus to extensive
  cortical regions-respond to consecutive stimuli with graded changes in
  firing frequency that remain stable after each stimulus presentation. In
  addition, the sustained levels of firing frequency can be either increased
  or decreased in an input-specific manner. This firing behaviour displays
  robustness to distractors; it is linked to cholinergic muscarinic receptor
activation, and relies on activity-dependent changes of a Ca2+-sensitive
cationic current. Such an intrinsic neuronal ability to generate graded
persistent activity constitutes an elementary mechanism for working memory.},

It differed from cued recall only in the instructions, which directed subjects away from the memory aspects of the test and asked them to complete each three-letter cue with the first word that came to mind.

However, it is also possible to retain both the colour and the orientation of four objects, indicating that visual working memory stores integrated objects rather than individual features. Indeed, objects defined by a conjunction of four features can be retained in working memory just as well as single-feature objects, allowing sixteen individual features to be retained when distributed across four objects. Thus, the capacity of visual working memory must be understood in terms of integrated objects rather than individual features, which places significant constraints on cognitive and neurobiological models of the temporary storage of visual information.},

A new finding was that the perirhinal cortex neurons were actively reset between trials: when a particular image was shown as a sample on a succeeding trial, the response was much larger than when it had been shown as a match image a short time previously on the previous trial. This resetting between trials appears to reflect the operation of an active working memory process rather than a passive temporal decay in a neuronal response.

Half of the rats were disoriented before being placed in the cylinder, in order to disrupt their internal sense of direction. The other half were not disoriented before being placed in the cylinder; for these rats, there was presumably a consistent relationship between the cue card and their internal direction sense. We subsequently recorded hippocampal place cells and thalamic head direction cells from both groups of rats as they moved in the cylinder; between some sessions the cylinder and cue card were rotated to a new direction. All rats were disoriented before recording. Under these conditions, the cue card had much weaker control over the place fields and head direction cells in the rats that had been disoriented during training than in the rats that had not been disoriented. For the former group, the place fields often rotated relative to the cue card or completely changed their firing properties between sessions. In all recording sessions, the head direction cells and place cells were strongly coupled. It appears that the strength of cue control over place cells and head direction cells depends on the rat's learned perception of the stability of the cues.},

	Annote = {The location-specific firing of hippocampal place cells can easily be brought under the control of experimenter-defined cues. Nevertheless, there is evidence that these firing fields are not determined just by immediate sensory input, but also by earlier states of the nervous system (O'Keefe and Speakman, 1987). Here, we report further on the roles of multiple visual cues and mnemonic processes in determining the firing of place cells. Rats were trained to chase food pellets in a cylinder with homogeneous gray walls and 1 white cue card. After a cell's field was recorded in this 'standard' condition, probe sessions were conducted in which a second card was placed 180 degrees away from the first. This configuration created a diametrically symmetrical environment in which pairs of locations 180 degrees apart were identical with respect to views of the wall and cards. If place cells are strongly controlled by these immediately available views, firing in the 2-card configuration should be diametrically symmetrical. Alternatively, because the rat moves freely in the cylinder, information is available that pairs of visually identical places are not truly the same. If some mnemonic process stores and updates information about the rat's paths during the session, it is possible that the firing pattern will be different in 2 such places, especially because the original training was conducted in the 1-card, asymmetrical environment. Thirteen of 18 cells had a single, asymmetric firing pattern after the second card was introduced; the field was the same size and shape as in the 1-card configuration and in the same spatial relation to 1 of the 2 cards. The field position during 2-card sessions could be rotated 180 degrees by starting the rat by one card or the other. In further probe sessions in which the cue cards, entry location, and background cues were, in various combinations, rotated in relation to each other, these cells always showed a single field, similar in size and shape to that in the standard, and in the same relationship as in the standard to as many cues as possible. The remaining 5 cells showed complex changes over repeated 2-card sessions, and 3 of these showed paired fields, 180 degrees apart for at least some of the sessions. In one case, the second field disappeared with repeated exposures to 2 cards; in another, the second field persisted when only 1 card was used. We conclude that place cells are influenced both by the immediate sensory configuration and by internal neural states related to earlier experience in the environment.},

The comparable regions in the primate brain are the perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices. The perirhinal and postrhinal/parahippocampal cortices provide the major polysensory input to the hippocampus through their entorhinal connections and are the recipients of differing combinations of sensory information. The differences in the perirhinal and postrhinal cortical afferentation have important functional implications, in part, because these two regions project with different terminal patterns to the entorhinal cortex. The perirhinal cortex projects preferentially to the lateral entorhinal area (LEA), and the postrhinal cortex projects preferentially to the medial entorhinal area (MEA) and the caudal portion of LEA. Although the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices provide the major cortical input to the entorhinal cortex, the entorhinal cortex itself receives some direct cortical input. An examination of the cortical afferentation of the entorhinal cortex reveals an interesting principle of connectivity among these regions; the composition of the direct neocortical input to the LEA is more similar to that of the perirhinal cortex, and the composition of the direct neocortical input to the MEA is more similar to that of the postrhinal cortex. Thus, polymodal associational input to the LEA and the MEA exhibits some segregation and is organized in parallel. The organization of intrinsic connections for each of the parahippocampal regions also contributes to the segregation of information into parallel pathways.},

Because these experiments used a common behavioral procedure, trial-unique visual delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS), a quantitative synthesis ('meta-analysis') was performed to determine whether hippocampal lesions produced a reliable net impairment in DNMS performance, and whether this impairment was related to the magnitude of hippocampal damage. A similar analysis was performed on data from monkeys with perirhinal or rhinal cortex damage (Meunier et al., J Neurosci 1993;13:5418-5432; Buffalo et al., Learn Mem 1999;6:572-599). DNMS performance scores were transformed to d' values to permit comparisons across studies, and a loss in d' score, a measure of the magnitude of the recognition deficit relative to the control group, was calculated for each operated monkey. Two main findings emerged. First, the loss in d' following hippocampal damage was reliably larger than zero, but was smaller than that found after lesions limited to the perirhinal cortex. Second, the correlation of loss in d' with extent of hippocampal damage was large and negative, indicating that greater impairments were associated with smaller hippocampal lesions. This relationship was opposite to that between loss in d' and rhinal cortex damage, for which larger lesions were associated with greater impairment. These findings indicate that damage to the hippocampus and to the rhinal cortex affects recognition memory in different ways. Furthermore, they provide a framework for understanding the seemingly disparate effects of hippocampal damage on recognition memory in monkeys, and by extension, for interpreting the conflicting reports on the effects of such damage on recognition memory abilities in amnesic humans.},

Moreover, different aspects of cDNM performance were shown to be differentially sensitive to selective lesions of the orbitofrontal and parahippocampal areas. Orbitofrontal cortex lesions disproportionately impaired cDNM acquisition; delay performance was impaired only under conditions of elevated levels of interitem interference. Combined perirhinal and entorhinal cortical lesions had no effect on cDNM acquisition but impaired cDNM performance at longer delays across all levels of interference. Fornix lesions did not impair either acquisition of cDNM or subsequent performance across long delays and increased interference. This pattern of impaired and spared capacities is similar to that observed in monkeys after lesions of analogous areas and is consistent with the notion that the prefrontal cortical system contributes preferentially to learning general task 'rules' such as the nonmatching rule that is inherent in cDNM, whereas the perirhinal and entorhinal cortical areas are involved in the intermediate-term maintenance of memories for specific information.},

More recent work, however, has shown that removal of the rhinal cortex, a region subjacent to the amygdala and rostral hippocampus, yields nearly the same impairment as the original removal. This raises the possibility that the earlier results were attributable to combined damage to the rostral and caudal portions of the rhinal cortex rather than to the combined amygdala and hippocampal removal. To test this possibility, we trained rhesus monkeys on delayed nonmatching-to-sample, a measure of visual recognition, gave them selective lesions of the amygdala and hippocampus made with the excitotoxin ibotenic acid, and then assessed their recognition abilities by using increasingly longer delays and list lengths, including delays as long as 40 min. Postoperatively, monkeys with the combined amygdala and hippocampal lesions performed as well as intact controls at every stage of testing. The same monkeys also were unimpaired relative to controls on an analogous test of spatial memory, delayed nonmatching-to-location. It is unlikely that unintended sparing of target structures can account for the lack of impairment; there was a significant positive correlation between the percentage of damage to the hippocampus and scores on portions of the recognition performance test, suggesting that, paradoxically, the greater the hippocampal damage, the better the recognition. The results show that, within the medial temporal lobe, the rhinal cortex is both necessary and sufficient for visual recognition.},

Unfortunately, assessment of the functional significance of damage to either of these pathways has not used tasks known to be sensitive to hippocampal function in the rodent.

Consistent with a two-stage model of spatial learning proposed by Buzsaki (Buzsaki G. Two-stage model of memory trace formation: a role for 'noisy' brain states.

In the Tower of London test, a puzzle in which beads sliding on pegs must be moved to match a designated goal configuration, patients with lesioned prefrontal cortex show deficits in planning a goal-directed sequence of moves. We propose a neuronal network model of sequence planning that passes this test and, when lesioned, fails in a way that mimics prefrontal patients' behavior. Our model comprises a descending planning system with hierarchically organized plan, operation, and gesture levels, and an ascending evaluative system that analyzes the problem and computes internal reward signals that index the correct/erroneous status of the plan. Multiple parallel pathways connecting the evaluative and planning systems amend the plan and adapt it to the current problem. The model illustrates how specialized hierarchically organized neuronal assemblies may collectively emulate central executive or supervisory functions of the human brain.},

Ablations of the perirhinal cortex alone produced a deficit nearly as severe as that found after rhinal cortex lesions, whereas ablations of the entorhinal cortex alone produced only a mild deficit. Contrary to the conclusion from an earlier study (Murray and Mishkin, 1986), the present results demonstrate not only that damage limited to the rhinal cortex is sufficient to produce a severe loss in visual recognition, but also that such damage leads to a far greater loss than damage to any other single structure in the medial part of the temporal lobe.},

	Annote = {Direct observation and automatic, video-based methods reveal that a large fraction of hippocampal pyramidal neurons recorded from freely moving rats behave as 'place cells'; the firing of each place cell occurs almost exclusively when the rat is in a restricted part of its current environment. In earlier work, 2-dimensional firing distributions for place cells over the apparatus area were made under the assumption that the correct location for each spike was the animal's position at the instant that the spike was fired. Spatial firing distributions generated in this way often have a very simple structure, in which the single region of intense activity has a just one maximum, and where the rate decreases monotonically in all directions away from the maximum. We will refer to patterns of this sort as 'ideal.' We describe how the spatial firing pattern is altered by assigning spikes to positions earlier or later than the instant at which they were fired. Spatial firing distributions were generated for a range of constant displacements of the spike time-series against the position time series. Three quantitative measures were used to estimate the extent to which the spatial firing pattern at different 'spike/position shifts' approximated the ideal pattern. The 3 measures are in agreement that spikes must precede the animal's position by about 120 msec for the spatial firing pattern to be closest to the ideal. These results suggest that hippocampal unit activity predicts the animal's future location on a short time scale.},

This behaviorally induced, experience-dependent expression of neuronal plasticity was blocked by the NMDA(R) antagonist CPP, suggesting that it may result from the temporal asymmetry and associative properties of LTP. NMDA(R) antagonism, however, had no effect on the range of the progressive shift of firing phase of hippocampal cells, relative to the theta rhythm, as the rat traverses the cell's 'place field.' Thus, when place fields normally expand with experience, the relationship between firing phase and position is altered, as predicted by models that account for 'phase precession' on the basis of asymmetry of synaptic connection strengths. These effects of CPP mimic changes that occur during normal aging, suggesting mechanisms by which sequence learning deficits may arise in aged animals.},

Second, while the place fields are symmetric at the beginning of a session, they become highly asymmetric with experience. Further experiments suggest that these results are likely to arise due to synaptic plasticity during behavior. Using a purely feed forward neural network model, we show that following repeated directional activation, NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation/long-term depotentiation (LTP/LTD) could result in an experience-dependent asymmetrization of receptive fields.},

	Annote = {Populations of hippocampal neurons were recorded simultaneously in rats shuttling on a track between a fixed reward site at one end and a movable reward site, mounted in a sliding box, at the opposite end. While the rat ran toward the fixed site, the box was moved. The rat returned to the box in its new position. On the initial part of all journeys, cells fired at fixed distances from the origin, whereas on the final part, cells fired at fixed distances from the destination. Thus, on outward journeys from the box, with the box behind the rat, the position representation must have been updated by path integration. Farther along the journey, the place field map became aligned on the basis of external stimuli. The spatial representation was quantified in terms of population vectors. During shortened journeys, the vector shifted from an alignment with the origin to an alignment with the destination. The dynamics depended on the degree of mismatch with respect to the full-length journey. For small mismatches, the vector moved smoothly through intervening coordinates until the mismatch was corrected. For large mismatches, it jumped abruptly to the new coordinate. Thus, when mismatches occur, path integration and external cues interact competitively to control place-cell firing. When the same box was used in a different environment, it controlled the alignment of a different set of place cells. These data suggest that although map alignment can be controlled by landmarks, hippocampal neurons do not explicitly represent objects or events.},

	Annote = {The discharge characteristics of postsubicular head-direction cells in a fixed environment were described in the previous paper (Taube et al., 1990). This paper reports changes in the firing properties of head-direction cells following changes in the animal's environment. Head-direction cells were recorded from rats as they moved freely in a 76-cm-diameter gray cylinder. A white card, occupying 100 degrees of arc, was taped to the inside wall of the cylinder and served as the major orienting spatial cue in the animal's environment. Rotation of the cue card produced near-equal rotation in the preferred firing direction of head-direction cells, with minimal changes in peak firing rate, directional firing range, or asymmetry of the firing-rate/head-direction function. Card removal had no effect on peak firing rate or range of firing, but in 8/13 cells the preferred direction rotated by at least 24 degrees. Similarly, changing the shape of the environment to a rectangular or square enclosure caused the preferred firing direction to rotate by at least 48 degrees for 8/10 cells in the rectangle and 3/8 cells in the square, with minimal changes in the peak firing rate or directional firing range. Hand holding the animals and moving them around the cylinder had no effect on the preferred direction or firing range of the cell, but decreased the maximal firing rate in 7/9 cells. On 2 occasions, 2 head-direction cells were recorded simultaneously. The rotation of the preferred firing direction for one cell was the same as the rotation of the preferred direction for the second cell after each environmental manipulation. These results demonstrate that specific visual cues in the environment can exert control over the preferred firing direction and indicate that head-direction cell firing is not a simple sensory response to visual cues, but rather represents more abstract information concerning the animal's spatial relationship with its environment. The constancy of the angle between the preferred firing directions of pairs of simultaneously recorded head-direction cells suggests that there is a fixed mapping of the population onto direction within the environment. Thus, environmental manipulations appear to cause only a change in the reference direction, but leave all other discharge characteristics of directional cells unchanged. In the discussion, comparisons are drawn between the responses of head-direction cells and hippocampal place cells to similar environmental manipulations (Muller and Kubie, 1987), and ways in which these 2 spatial systems interact in navigation are discussed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The internal direction represented by these cells uses both self-motion information for inertially based updating and familiar visual landmarks for calibration. Here, a model of the dynamics of the HD cell ensemble is presented. The stability of a localized static activity profile in the network and a dynamic shift mechanism are explained naturally by synaptic weight distribution components with even and odd symmetry, respectively. Under symmetric weights or symmetric reciprocal connections, a stable activity profile close to the known directional tuning curves will emerge. By adding a slight asymmetry to the weights, the activity profile will shift continuously without disturbances to its shape, and the shift speed can be controlled accurately by the strength of the odd-weight component. The generic formulation of the shift mechanism is determined uniquely within the current theoretical framework. The attractor dynamics of the system ensures modality-independence of the internal representation and facilitates the correction for cumulative error by the putative local-view detectors. The model offers a specific one-dimensional example of a computational mechanism in which a truly world-centered representation can be derived from observer-centered sensory inputs by integrating self-motion information.},

In the present study, we tested whether memory encoding is put forward at this stage, i.e., whether association between the representations of different but semantically linked objects proceeds forward from TE to A36. To address this question, we trained monkeys in a pair-association (PA) memory task, after which single-unit activities were recorded from TE and A36 during PA trials. Neurons in both areas showed stimulus-selective cue responses (347 in TE, 76 in A36; 'cue-selective neurons') that provided, at the population level, mnemonic linkage between the paired associates. The percentage of neurons in which responses to the paired associates were significantly (p &#60; 0.01) correlated at the single-neuron level ('pair-coding neuron') dramatically increased from TE (4.9% of the cue-selective neurons) to A36 (33%). The pair-coding neurons in A36 were further separable into Type1 (68%) and Type2 (32%) on the basis of their initial transient responses after cue stimulus presentation. Type1 neurons, but not Type2 neurons, began to encode association between paired stimuli as soon as they exhibited stimulus selectivity. Thus, the representation of long-term memory encoded by Type1 neurons in A36 is likely substantiated without feedback input from other higher centers. Therefore, we conclude that association between the representations of the paired associates proceeds forward at this critical step within IT cortex, suggesting selective convergence onto a single A36 neuron from two TE neurons that encode separate visual objects.},

Place fields were recorded with a video monitoring system that recorded movements as the animal explored each of the 5 cup locations where water was delivered on the platform. Plasticity of place cell firing as a function of selective water delivery to specific cup locations on the platform was also examined. Several characteristics of place cell firing were studied that indicated a high degree of control by factors such as relative direction of movement and trajectory through the field. Time-shift analyses indicated cell firing was most representative of the place field at the time of spike occurrence. It was demonstrated that place fields possess borders in which firing was increased or decreased upon entering or leaving a particular region of the platform. The most important finding from this investigation was the pronounced degree of plasticity exhibited by place cells. Selective delivery of water to a single location on the platform was sufficient in most of the cases tested to shift the location of the field to the location where water was available. These findings suggest hippocampal place cell firing, although highly influenced by spatial and directional features of the environment, can readily change under conditions in which significant stimuli are added or removed from those locations.},

Thus, it appears that there is no single cortical site or circuit responsible for episodic encoding. The results of retrieval studies indicate that successful recollection of episodic information is associated with activation of lateral parietal cortex, along with more variable patterns of activity in dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal cortex. Whereas parietal regions may play a part in the representation of retrieved information, prefrontal areas appear to support processes that act on the products of retrieval to align behaviour with the demands of the retrieval task.},

  the dorsal one-third (largely for technical convenience). The present study
  therefore compared the spatial selectivity of CA1 neurons in the dorsal and
  ventral hippocampi of rats during performance of a food reinforced, random
  search task in a square chamber containing simple visual landmarks. Neural
  activity was recorded in the dorsal and ventral hippocampi of opposite
  hemispheres in the same rats, in many cases simultaneously. As in dorsal

  cells fired at relatively high rates and with low spatial selectivity in the
  apparatus. Of the population of complex spike cells in the ventral
hippocampus, a significantly smaller number had 'place fields' than in the
dorsal hippocampus, and the average spatial selectivity was of significantly
lower resolution than that found among dorsal hippocampal complex spike cells.
Thus, a septotemporal difference of spatial selectivity was found in the CA1
field of the rat hippocampus, complementing many other anatomical and

damage on timing and the memory for temporal events. Norway rats (N=20) were
trained to discriminate between auditory signals that differed in both
duration (2 or 8 sec) and rate (2 or 16 cycles/sec). After Ss acquired the
discrimination, signals with intermediate durations and rates were presented.
Ss then received either fimbria-fornix lesions or control operations.
Postoperatively, the accuracy of duration and rate discriminations as measured
by the difference limen (DL) was unaffected by the lesion, but the point of
subjective equality was shifted to a shorter duration and a slower rate by the
lesion. Both Ss with lesions and Ss with control operations showed cross-modal
transfer of duration and rate from the auditory signals used in training to
visual signals. When a 5-sec delay was imposed between the end of a signal and
the opportunity to respond, lesioned Ss were selectively impaired by the
addition of the delay as measured by an increase in the DL. When a peak
procedure was employed, the maximum response rate of controls was
approximately at the time of scheduled reinforcement (20 sec), but the maximum
response rate of lesioned Ss was earlier than the time of reinforcement. When
a 5-sec gap was imposed in the signal, controls summed the signal durations
before and after the gap, whereas lesioned Ss showed no retention of the
signal duration prior to the gap. Lesions impaired spatial working memory in
an 8-arm radial maze. (51 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2004 APA, all

	Annote = {Single electrode recording in the inferotemporal
  cortex of monkeys during delayed visual memory tasks provide evidence for
  attractor dynamics in the observed region. The persistent elevated delay
  activities could be internal representations of features of the learned
  visual stimuli shown to the monkey during training. When uncorrelated
  stimuli are presented during training in a fixed sequence, these experiments
  display significant correlations between the internal representations.
  Recently a simple model of attractor neural network has reproduced
  quantitatively the measured correlations. An underlying assumption of the
  model is that the synaptic matrix formed during the training phase contains
  in its efficacies information about the contiguity of persistent stimuli in
  the training sequence. We present here a simple unsupervised learning
  dynamics that produces such a synaptic matrix if sequences of stimuli are
  repeatedly presented to the network at fixed order. The resulting matrix is
  then shown to convert temporal correlations during training into spatial
  correlations between attractors. The scenario is that, in the presence of
selective delay activity, at the presentation of each stimulus, the activity
distribution in the neural assembly contain information of both the current
stimulus and the previous one (carried by the attractor). Thus the recurrent
synaptic matrix can code not only for each of the stimuli presented to the
network but also for their context. We combine the idea that for learning to
be effective, synaptic modification should be stochastic, with the fact that

calculate explicitly the probability distribution of synaptic efficacies as a
function of training protocol, that is, the order in which stimuli are
presented to the network. We then solve for the dynamics of a network composed
of integrate-and-fire excitatory and inhibitory neurons with a matrix of

stable spontaneous activity, and stable delay activity develops after a
critical learning stage. The availability of a learning dynamics makes
possible a number of experimental predictions for the dependence of the delay

  pair-associate tasks have revealed neuronal correlates of long-term memory
  of associations between stimuli. Here, a recurrent cortical network model
  with Hebbian plastic synapses is subjected to the pair-associate protocol.
  In a first stage, learning leads to the appearance of delay activity,
  representing individual images (&apos;retrospective&apos; activity). As
  learning proceeds, the same learning mechanism uses retrospective delay
  activity together with choice stimulus activity to potentiate synapses
  connecting neural populations representing associated images. As a result,
  the neural population corresponding to the pair-associate of the image
  presented is activated prior to its visual stimulation
  (&apos;prospective&apos; activity). The probability of appearance of
  prospective activity is governed by the strength of the inter-population
connections, which in turn depends on the frequency of pairings during
training. The time course of the transitions from retrospective to prospective
activity during the delay period is found to depend on the fraction of slow,
	N-methyl-d-aspartate-like receptors at excitatory synapses. For fast
	recurrent excitation, transitions are abrupt; slow recurrent excitation
	renders transitions gradual. Both scenarios lead to a gradual rise of
	delay activity when averaged over many trials, because of the stochastic
	nature of the transitions. The model reproduces most of the

especially accurate when a continuity constraint was enforced, and the best
errors were within a factor of two of the information-theoretic limit on how
accurate any reconstruction can be and were comparable with the intrinsic
experimental errors in position tracking. In addition, the reconstruction
analysis uncovered some interesting aspects of place cell activity, such as
the tendency for erratic jumps of the reconstructed trajectory when the animal

  A more detailed analysis of the simulations across training trials reveals

  of the sequential states of a network. This greater variation is not
  uniformly present during training; it is largely restricted to the beginning

  variation is high early in training, but not later. This automatic

Finally, even when the new spatial representations became bound to the landmarks, they were multi-stable across repetitive exposures to the formerly novel environment.

  To investigate this issue, we scanned younger and older adults with

  There were three main results. First, in all three tasks, older adults

  view that sensory processing decline is a common cause in cognitive aging,

  younger adults during working memory and visual attention tasks. These
  findings are consistent with the Hemispheric Asymmetry Reduction in Older

parahippocampal activity in the episodic retrieval task. The former finding
suggests that age-related hippocampal deficits may have a global effect in

Studies of the effects of aging on hippocampal anatomy, physiology,
plasticity, and network dynamics may lead to a better understanding of
age-related cognitive deficits. Anatomical and electrophysiological studies
indicate that the hippocampus of the aged rat sustains a loss of synapses in
the dentate gyrus, a loss of functional synapses in area CA1, a decrease in
the NMDA-receptor-mediated response at perforant path synapses onto dentate
gyrus granule cells, and an alteration of Ca(2+) regulation in area CA1. These
changes may contribute to the observed age-related impairments of synaptic
plasticity, which include deficits in the induction and maintenance of
long-term potentiation (LTP) and lower thresholds for depotentiation and
long-term depression (LTD). This shift in the balance of LTP and LTD could, in
turn, impair the encoding of memories and enhance the erasure of memories, and
therefore contribute to cognitive deficits experienced by many aged mammals.
Altered synaptic plasticity may also change the dynamic interactions among
cells in hippocampal networks, causing deficits in the storage and retrieval
of information about the spatial organization of the environment. Further
studies of the aged hippocampus will not only lead to treatments for
age-related cognitive impairments, but may also clarify the mechanisms of
learning in adult mammals.},

Prior research on familiarity and recollection has relied on verbal material. Whereas word meanings and pronunciations are well learned in advance, here we produced pure familiarity and recollection using photographs of faces never seen before the experiment. When participants recognized a face, recollection was inferred if they also remembered either the occupation associated with that face earlier in the experiment or any other episodic detail. Pure familiarity was inferred when recognition occurred in the absence of any such contextual retrieval. Analyses of brain potentials recorded during initial encoding showed that right-sided neural activity predicted subsequent face familiarity, whereas bilateral potentials predicted subsequent face recollection. Results during memory testing were inconsistent with the popular idea that familiarity is generically indexed by reduced frontal N400-like potentials. Instead, both memory experiences were associated with bilateral, parietal-maximum brain potentials, although with smaller amplitudes and for a shorter duration for familiarity.

  engagement during autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval. Although the basis
  of this preferential activation remains unclear, it may be related to the
  temporal specificity, recency, or recollective qualities of AMs, such as
  detail, emotionality, and personal significance. Typically, however, these
  variables are confounded, and thus we sought to investigate the
  contributions of each to hippocampal activation during AM retrieval. We
  conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  study in which participants retrieved temporally specific AMs and general,
  repeated AMs, and rated each for level of detail, emotion, or personal
  significance. These ratings, as well as the recency of AMs, were used in
  parametric modulation analyses to identify brain regions that correlated
  positively with ratings, independent of recency, and vice versa. Retrieval
  of AMs activated a number of regions, including the hippocampus. No
  differences in hippocampal activation were evident between specific and
general AM retrieval, suggesting that temporal specificity, on its own, is not
a key modulator of hippocampal activation. Activation of the left hippocampus
during specific AM retrieval did vary with the level of detail, personal
significance, and at a subthreshold level, emotionality, when the effect of
recency was covaried out. Further, during general AM retrieval, all three
recollective qualities modulated activity in the right hippocampus. Although
the recency of specific AMs modulated hippocampal activation bilaterally, this
effect dissipated in the left hippocampus when detail or emotionality was
included as a covariate, and was no longer present in either hippocampus when
personal significance was taken into account. Our results suggest that
recollective qualities are important predictors of hippocampal engagement
during AM retrieval independent of factors such as recency. These findings are
consistent with theories of hippocampal function that emphasize its role in
the recollection of multifaceted autobiographical experiences.},

senescent changes in frontal-hippocampal circuitry but has not been formally
linked to impaired neuromodulation involving this circuitry. Previous
neurocomputational work showed that impaired neuromodulation could result in
less distinct neurocognitive representations. Here we extend this
computational principle to simulate aging-related deficits in associative
binding. As expected, networks with simulated deficiency in neuromodulation
resulted in less distinct internal representations than did networks
simulating the processing and performance of young adults, and were also more
impaired under task conditions that required associative binding. The findings
suggest that senescent changes in neuromodulatory mechanisms may play a basic
role in aging-related impairment in associative binding by reducing the

    discussion is organized in a somewhat spiral fashion. Landauer first
    raises the issue of the basic elements of empirical association and
    illustrates it by the case of learned object recognition. This leads to
    the hypothesis that the choice of optimal elements may provide a small
    part of the solution of the problem; what is done with the co-occurring
    elements appears to be more important. He then moves to the learning of
    word and passage meaning because this domain exhibits the problem in a
    manner that is convenient to model; we can give a computer the very same
    mass of perceptual input that literate humans use for much of their
    learning. Landauer first shows how a different kind of co-occurrence data
    and a different form of computation can yield more knowledge that has
    usually been supposed. Next, he explains how these ideas are implemented
    in the latent semantic analysis (LSA) learning model through singular

  of detailed, vivid autobiographical memories depend on the hippocampal
  system no matter how long ago they were acquired. Semantic memories, on the
  other hand, benefit from hippocampal contribution for some time before they
  can be retrieved independently of the hippocampus. Even semantic memories,
  however, can have episodic elements associated with them that continue to
  depend on the hippocampus. Likewise, we distinguish between experientially
  detailed spatial memories (akin to episodic memory) and more schematic
  memories (akin to semantic memory) that are sufficient for navigation but
  not for re-experiencing the environment in which they were acquired.  Like
  their episodic and semantic counterparts, the former type of spatial memory
  is dependent on the hippocampus no matter how long ago it was acquired,
  whereas the latter can survive independently of the hippocampus and is
  represented in extra-hippocampal structures. In short, the evidence reviewed
  suggests strongly that the function of the hippocampus (and possibly that of
  related limbic structures) is to help encode, retain, and retrieve
  experiences, no matter how long ago the events comprising the experience
  occurred, and no matter whether thevents comprising the experience occurred,

develops; ``this generalization gradient of reaction strength is a monotonic
decreasing function of the magnitude of the differences between the
conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimuli;'' primary stimulus
generalized conditioned reaction tendencies are more susceptible to
experimental extinction than are reactions actually conditioned to the

systematically extinguishing one or more generalized stimuli, steepens the

@article{Mack75,
	Annote = {Abstract:  Review of the literature indicates that, according to
 theories of selective attention, learning about a stimulus depends on
 attending to that stimulus; this is represented in 2-stage models by saying
 that Ss switch in analyzers as well as learning stimulus-response
 associations. It is argued that this assumption, however, is equally well
 represented in a formal model by the incorporation of a stimulus-specific
 learning-rate parameter, a, into the equations describing changes in the
 associative strength of stimuli.  Previous theories of selective attention
 have also assumed that (a) Ss learn to attend to and ignore relevant and
 irrelevant stimuli (i.e., that a may increase or decrease depending on the
 correlation of a stimulus with reinforcement); and (b) there is an inverse
 relationship between the probabilities of attending to different stimuli
 (i.e., that an increase in a to one stimulus is accompanied by a decrease in
 a to others). The first assumption has been used to explain the phenomena of
 acquired distinctiveness and dimensional transfer, the second to explain
 those of overshadowing and blocking. It is argued that although the first
 assumption is justified by the data, the second is not: Overshadowing and
 blocking are better explained by the choice of an appropriate rule for
 changing a, such that a decreases to stimuli that signal no change from the
 probability of reinforcement predicted by other stimuli. (65 ref) (PsycINFO

	Annote = {Miller (1956) summarized evidence that people can
              remember about seven chunks in short-term memory (STM) tasks.
              However, that number was meant more as a rough estimate and a
              rhetorical device than as a real capacity limit. Others have
              since suggested that there is a more precise capacity limit, but
              that it is only three to five chunks. The present target article
              brings together a wide variety of data on capacity limits
              suggesting that the smaller capacity limit is real. Capacity
              limits will be useful in analyses of information processing only
              if the boundary conditions for observing them can be carefully
                  described. Four basic conditions in which chunks can be
                  identified and capacity limits can accordingly be observed
                  are: (1) when information overload limits chunks to
                  individual stimulus items, (2) when other steps are taken
                  specifically to block the recording of stimulus items into
                  larger chunks, (3) in performance discontinuities caused by
                  the capacity limit, and (4) in various indirect effects of
                  the capacity limit. Under these conditions, rehearsal and
                  long-term memory cannot be used to combine stimulus items
                  into chunks of an unknown size; nor can storage mechanisms
                  that are not capacity-limited, such as sensory memory, allow
                  the capacity-limited storage mechanism to be refilled during
                  recall. A single, central capacity limit averaging about
                  four chunks is implicated along with other,
                  noncapacity-limited sources. The pure STM capacity limit
                  expressed in chunks is distinguished from compound STM
                  limits obtained when the number of separately held chunks is
                  unclear. Reasons why pure capacity estimates fall within a
                  narrow range are discussed and a capacity limit for the
                  focus of attention is proposed.},

synfire chains and single-cell bistability. The models show how sustained
activity can be stable in the presence of noise and distractors, how different
synaptic and voltage-gated conductances contribute to persistent activity, how
neuromodulation could influence its robustness, how completely novel items
could be maintained, and how continuous attractor states might be achieved.

show that a parametric working memory model capable of graded persistent

factors and power spectra of neural activity described by the power laws of a
random walk.  Collective drifts of the mnemonic firing pattern induce
long-term noise correlations between pairs of cells, with the sign (positive

their tuning curves. None of the power-law behavior was observed in a variant
of the model endowed with discrete bistable neural groups, where noise
fluctuations were unable to cause long-term changes in rate.  Therefore such
behavior can serve as a probe for a quasi-continuous attractor. We propose
that the unusual correlated fluctuations have important implications for
neural coding in parametric working memory circuits.},

	Annote = {Working memory has often been modeled and conceptualized as a
kind of binary (bistable) memory switch, where stimuli turn on plateau-like
persistent activity in subsets of cells, in line with many in vivo
electrophysiological reports. A potentially related form of bistability,
termed up- and down-states, has been studied with regard to its synaptic and
ionic basis in vivo and in reduced cortical preparations. Also single cell
mechanisms for producing bistability have been proposed and investigated in
brain slices and computationally.  Recently, however, it has been emphasized
that clear plateau-like bistable activity is rather rare during working memory
tasks, and that neurons exhibit a multitude of different temporally unfolding
activity profiles and temporal structure within their spiking dynamics. Hence,
working memory seems to be a highly dynamical neural process with yet unknown
mappings from dynamical to computational properties.  Empirical findings on
ramping activity profiles and temporal structure will be reviewed, as well as
neural models that attempt to account for it and its computational
significance. Furthermore, recent in vivo, neural culture, and in vitro
preparations will be discussed that offer new possibilities for studying the
biophysical mechanisms underlying computational processes during working
memory. These preparations have revealed additional evidence for temporal
structure and spatio-temporally organized attractor states in cortical
networks, as well as for specific computational properties that may
characterize synaptic processing during high-activity states as during working
memory.  Together such findings may lay the foundations for highly dynamical
theories of working memory based on biophysical principles.},

	Annote = {Although most observers agree that the hippocampus has a critical
 role in learning and memory, there remains considerable debate about the
 precise functional contribution of the hippocampus to these processes. Two of
 the most influential accounts hold that the primary function of the
 hippocampus is to generate cognitive maps and to mediate episodic memory
 processes. The well-documented spatial firing patterns (place fields) of
 hippocampal neurons in rodents, along with the spatial learning impairments
 observed with hippocampal damage support the cognitive mapping hypothesis.
 The amnesia for personally experienced events seen in humans with hippocampal
 damage and the data of animal models, which show severe memory deficits
 associated with hippocampal lesions, support the episodic memory account.
 Although an extensive literature supports each of these hypotheses, a
 specific contribution of place cells to episodic memory has not been clearly
 demonstrated. Recent data from our laboratory, together with previous
 findings, indicate that hippocampal place fields and neuronal responses to
 task-relevant stimuli are highly sensitive to the context, even when the
 contexts are defined by abstract task demands rather than the spatial
 geometry of the environment. On the basis of these findings, it is proposed
 that place fields reflect a more general context processing function of the
 hippocampus. Hippocampal context representations could serve to differentiate
 contexts and prime the relevant memories and behaviors. Since episodic
 memories, by definition, include information about the time and place where
 the episode occurred, contextual information is a necessary prerequisite for
 any episodic memory.  Thus, place fields contribute importantly to episodic
 memory as part of the needed context representations.  Additionally, recent
 findings indicate that hippocampal neurons differentiate contexts at
 progressively finer levels of detail, suggesting a hierarchical coding scheme
 which, if combined with temporal information, could provide a means of
 differentiating memory episodes.},

and episodic memories. Animal studies indicate that the hippocampus is also
required for relational learning tasks. A prototypical relational learning
task, and the one investigated in this experiment, using event-related
functional magnetic resonance imaging, is the transitive inference (TI) task.
In the TI task, participants were to choose between A and B (A?B) and learned
by trial and error to choose A (A > B). There were four such premise pairs
during a training (A > B, B > C, C > D, D > E). These can be acquired
distinctly or can be organized into a superordinate hierarchy (A > B > C > D >
E), which would efficiently represent all the learned relations and allow
inferences (e.g., B > D). At test there was no reinforcement: In addition to
premise pairs, untrained pairings were introduced (e.g., A?E, B?D). Correctly
inferring that B > D is taken as evidence for the formation of a superordinate
hierarchy; several alternatives to the superordinate hierarchy hypothesis are
considered.  Awareness of the formation of this hierarchy was measured by a
postscan questionnaire. Four main findings are reported: (1) Inferential
performance and task awareness dissociated behaviorally and at the level of
hemodynamic response; (2) As expected, performance on the inferred relation, B
> D, corresponded to the ability to simultaneously acquire B > C and C > D
premise pairs during training; (3) Interestingly, acquiring these 'inner
pairs' corresponded to greater hippocampal activation than the 'outer pairs'
(A > B, D > E) for all participants. However, a distinct pattern of
hippocampal activity for these inner pairs differentiated those able to
perform the inferential discrimination, B > D, at test. Because these inner
premise pairs require contextual discrimination (e.g., C is incorrect in the
context of B but correct in the context of D), we argue that the TI task is
hippocampal-dependent because the premise pair acquisition necessary for
inference is hippocampal-dependent; (4) We found B > D related hippocampal
activity at test that is anatomically consistent with preconsolidation recall

items (e.g., A+B-, B+C-, C+D-, and D+E-, where + and - indicate correct and

ability to exhibit transitive inference is thought to depend on the fact that
participants have represented the stimulus elements hierarchically (i.e.,
A>B>C>D>E).  We found that performance on five-item and six-item transitive

relationship among the elements of the training pairs. Participants who were
aware of the hierarchy performed near 100\% correct on all tests of
transitivity, but participants who were unaware of the hierarchy performed
poorly (e.g., on transitive pair BD in the five-item problem; on transitive
pairs BD, BE, and CE in the six-item problem). When the five-item task was
administered to memory-impaired patients with damage thought to be limited to
the hippocampal region, the patients were impaired at learning the training
pairs. All patients were unaware of the hierarchy and, like unaware controls,
performed poorly on the BD pair. The findings indicate that awareness is
critical for robust performance on tests of transitive inference and support
the view that awareness of what is learned is a fundamental characteristic of

time-varying recruitment of different neuron subsets, which were shaped by

frequency words than high frequency words for old and new items in recognition
memory.  Recently, several theorists have proposed dual-process accounts of
the word-frequency mirror effect. These accounts hypothesize that the low
frequency advantage on old items arises from increased recollection of these
items, while the low frequency advantage on new items arises from reduced
familiarity of these items. The authors tested these views using midazolam
amnesia on 36 subjects (aged 18-35 yrs). Based on the hypothesis that
midazolam amnesia should have larger effects on recollection than familiarity,
it was predicted that: (1) old high frequency words should have an advantage
over old low frequency words in a midazolam condition (i.e., the traditional
effect should reverse); and (2) the traditional advantage of new low frequency
words over new high frequency words should replicate in a midazolam condition.
Both predictions of the dual-process approach were confirmed. (PsycINFO

that the hippocampus is critical for recollection but not familiarity. The
parahippocampal cortex also contributes to recollection, possibly via the

probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is
intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word
sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all
the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful
approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short
overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse
of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which
allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number
of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a
distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability
function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations.
Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been
seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in
the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen
sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a
reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments
using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text

divide at the border between the hilus and the granule cell layer (GCL). In
adult rats, the progeny of these cells migrate into the GCL and express the

reduced immunoreactivity for poly-sialylated neural cell adhesion molecule, a

neurons. When animals were killed immediately (12 hr) after BrdU injection,
significantly fewer labeled cells were observed in the GCL and adjacent

theory of hippocampal coding, many computational models have been built on the
same key principles proposed by Marr: sparse representations, rapid Hebbian
storage, associative recall and consolidation. Most of these models have
focused on either the CA3 or CA1 fields, using 'off-the-shelf' learning
algorithms such as competitive learning or Hebbian pattern association.  Here,
we propose a novel coding principle that is common to all hippocampal regions,
and from this one principal, we derive learning rules for each of the major
pathways within the hippocampus. The learning rules turn out to have much in
common with several models of CA3 and CA1 in the literature, and provide a
unifying framework in which to view these models.  Simulations of the complete
circuit confirm that both recognition memory and recall are superior relative
to a hippocampally lesioned model, consistent with human data.  Further, we
propose a functional role for neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG), namely,
to create distinct memory traces for highly similar items. Our simulation
results support our prediction that memory capacity increases with the number
of dentate granule cells, while neuronal turnover with a fixed dentate layer
size improves recall, by minimizing interference between highly similar
items.},

Here we review results from functional neuroimaging studies showing that, whereas activity in the hippocampus and posterior parahippocampal gyrus is disproportionately associated with recollection, activity in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus is disproportionately associated with familiarity. The results are consistent with the idea that the parahippocampal cortex (located in the posterior parahippocampal gyrus) supports recollection by encoding and retrieving contextual information, whereas the hippocampus supports recollection by associating item and context information. By contrast, perirhinal cortex (located in the anterior parahippocampal gyrus) supports familiarity by encoding and retrieving specific item information. We discuss the implications of a 'binding of item and context' (BIC) model for studies of recognition memory. This model argues that there is no simple mapping between MTL regions and recollection and familiarity, but rather that the involvement of MTL regions in these processes depends on the specific demands of the task and the type of information involved. We highlight several predictions for future imaging studies that follow from the BIC model.},

Violations of this independence assumption can produce artifactual dissociations between estimates of R and A. Such artifactual dissociations were obtained in a series of word-stem completion experiments: R increased with presentation duration, whereas A, paradoxically, decreased. Direct evidence for nonindependence was obtained from correlations between R and A in each of the experiments.

systems are hampered by the need to create broad-coverage knowledge bases by
hand, making them difficult to adapt to new domains and potentially fragile if
critical information is omitted. To demonstrate how this problem might be
addressed, the Syntagmatic Paradigmatic model, a memory-based account of
sentence processing, is used to autonomously extract propositional knowledge
from unannotated text. The Syntagmatic Paradigmatic model assumes that people
store a large number of sentence instances. When trying to interpret a new
sentence, similar sentences are retrieved from memory and aligned with the new
sentence by using String Edit Theory. The set of alignments can be considered
an extensional interpretation of the sentence. Extracting propositional
information in this way not only permits the model to answer questions for
which the relevant facts are explicitly stated in the text but also allows the
model to take advantage of 'inference by coincidence,' where implicit
inference occurs as an emergent property of the mechanism. To illustrate the
potential of this approach, the model is tested for its ability to determine

                                  structures are thought to be capable of 1)
representing cortical activity in a way that minimizes overlap of the
representations assigned to different cortical patterns (pattern separation);
and 2) modifying synaptic connections so that these representations can later
be reinstated from partial or noisy versions of the cortical activity pattern
that was present at the time of storage (pattern completion). We point out
that there is a trade-off between pattern separation and completion and
propose that the unique anatomical and physiological properties of the
hippocampus might serve to minimize this trade-off. We use analytical methods
to determine quantitative estimates of both separation and completion for
specified parameterized models of the hippocampus.  These estimates are then
used to evaluate the role of various properties and of the hippocampus, such
as the activity levels seen in different hippocampal regions, synaptic
potentiation and depression, the multi-layer connectivity of the system, and
the relatively focused and strong mossy fiber projections. This analysis is
focused on the feedforward pathways from the entorhinal cortex (EC) to the
dentate gyrus (DG) and region CA3. Among our results are the following: 1)
Hebbian synaptic modification (LTP) facilitates completion but reduces
separation, unless the strengths of synapses from inactive presynaptic units
to active postsynaptic units are reduced (LTD). 2) Multiple layers, as in EC
to DG to CA3, allow the compounding of pattern separation, but not pattern
completion. 3) The variance of the input signal carried by the mossy fibers is
important for separation, not the raw strength, which may explain why the
mossy fiber inputs are few and relatively strong, rather than many and
relatively weak like the other hippocampal pathways. 4) The EC projects to CA3
both directly and indirectly via the DG, which suggests that the two-stage
pathway may dominate during pattern separation and the one-stage pathway may
dominate during completion; methods the hippocampus may use to enhance this
effect are discussed.},

ability to decorrelate overlapping input patterns before information is
stored. In the hippocampus, this neuronal pattern separation is expressed as
the tendency of ensembles of place cells to undergo extensive 'remapping' in
response to changes in the sensory or motivational inputs to the hippocampus.
Remapping is expressed under some conditions as a change of firing rates in
the presence of a stable place code ('rate remapping'), and under other
conditions as a complete reorganization of the hippocampal place code in which
both place and rate of firing take statistically independent values ('global
remapping').  Here we show that the nature of hippocampal remapping can be
predicted by ensemble dynamics in place-selective grid cells in the medial
entorhinal cortex, one synapse upstream of the hippocampus. Whereas rate
remapping is associated with stable grid fields, global remapping is always
accompanied by a coordinate shift in the firing vertices of the grid cells.
Grid fields of co-localized medial entorhinal cortex cells move and rotate in
concert during this realignment. In contrast to the multiple
environment-specific representations coded by place cells in the hippocampus,
local ensembles of grid cells thus maintain a constant spatial phase
structure, allowing position to be represented and updated by the same
translation mechanism in all environments encountered by the animal.},

conditions that promote memory retrieval (strong synaptic input from CA3 to
CA1). That model predicted that the preferred theta phase of CA1 spiking
should differ for information being encoded versus information being
retrieved. In the present study, the spiking activity of CA1 pyramidal cells
was recorded while rats performed either an odor-cued delayed
nonmatch-to-sample recognition memory test or an object recognition memory
task based on the animal's spontaneous preference for novelty. In the test
period of both tasks, the preferred theta phase exhibited by CA1 pyramidal
cells differed between moments when the rat inspected repeated (match) and
non-repeated (nonmatch) items. Also in the present study, additional modeling
work extended the previous model to address the mean phase of CA1 spiking
associated with stimuli inducing varying levels of retrieval relative to
encoding, ranging from novel nonmatch stimuli with no retrieval to highly
familiar repeated stimuli with extensive retrieval. The modeling results
obtained here demonstrated that the experimentally observed phase differences
are consistent with different levels of CA3 synaptic input to CA1 during

volume decreases at a slower rate than the hippocampal (HC) volume in healthy

METHODS: Volumes of the HC and EC were measured twice on MRI scans of 54
healthy adults (aged 26 to 82 years), with an average interval of 5 years.
RESULTS: Markedly different age trends were noted in the examined regions. The
EC showed no age-related differences on both occasions and only minimal
age-related change (0.33%/y). By contrast, the HC exhibited significant
age-related differences at baseline and at follow-up evaluation and decreased
at a faster pace of 0.86%/y. Older participants (aged > or = 50 years) showed
increased annual shrinkage of the HC (1.18%) and EC shrinkage (0.53%/y). The
rate of HC volume loss significantly exceeded that of the EC. No EC shrinkage
and modest HC volume reduction were observed in people aged <50 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Age-related shrinkage occurs in the medial temporal lobes of
healthy adults, with significant hippocampal decline and minimal entorhinal
changes. In both regions, the rate of decline accelerates with age, although
the role of pathologic factors in age-related increase of volume loss merits
further investigation.},

study the effects of healthy aging on hippocampal and rhinal memory functions.
Memory for past events can be based on retrieval accompanied by specific
contextual details (recollection) or on the feeling that an event is old or
new without the recovery of contextual details (familiarity). There is
evidence that recollection is more dependent on hippocampus, whereas
familiarity is more dependent on the rhinal cortex, and that healthy aging has
greater effects on recollection than on familiarity. However, little evidence
is available about the neural correlates of these effects. Here, we isolated
activity associated with recollection and familiarity by distinguishing
between linear and quasi-exponential 'perceived oldness' functions derived
from recognition confidence levels. The main finding was a double dissociation
within the medial temporal lobes between recollection-related activity in
hippocampus, which was reduced by aging, and familiarity-related activity in
rhinal cortex, which was increased by aging. In addition, age dissociations
were found within parietal and posterior midline regions. Finally, aging
reduced functional connectivity within a
hippocampal-retrosplenial/parietotemporal network but increased connectivity
within a rhinal-frontal network. These findings indicate that older adults
compensate for hippocampal deficits by relying more on rhinal cortex, possibly
through a top-down frontal modulation. This finding has important clinical
implications because early Alzheimer's disease impairs both hippocampus and

	Annote = {Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 28 young
adult subjects during a continuous recognition memory paradigm, with pictures
as stimuli.  Subjects were required to determine on each trial if the picture
was 'new' (never before presented) or 'old' (seen previously). To assess
differences between primary and secondary memory, old items were presented
after lags of 2, 8, and 32 intervening pictures (equiprobable) following their
first presentation. The results suggested that a negativity (Cz maximum) at
300 ms was the most likely candidate for the brain event reflecting the
retrieval of the item from memory. Old/new effects were modulated by two types
of activity, both of which were larger in the ERPs elicited by new items.  The
earlier of these, possibly similar to the N400, had a duration from about
250-600 ms, began with the N300 deflection, and lasted until 'P300' began to
decrement. The other was positive, resembled 'positive slow wave,' onset as
P300 began to decrement, and lasted until the end of the recording epoch.
There were no consistent effects of item lag on the behavioral data or on any
of the ERP components, suggesting that for pictorial stimuli, the distinction
between the two types of memory store, primary (i.e., immediate memory) and
secondary (newly learned information), may not be relevant.  In consonance
with the lack of lag effects, it was suggested that the lack of a robust
subsequent memory effect on the ERP waveform could have been due to the use of
pictures, which may have required less elaborative processing in order to be
encoded at input.},

	Annote = {Up to now, two conflicting theories have tried to explain the
genesis of averaged event-related potentials (ERPs): Whereas one hypothesis
claims that ERPs originate from an event-related activation of neural
assemblies distinct from background dynamics, the other hypothesis states that
ERPs are produced by phase resetting of ongoing oscillatory activity.  So far,
this question has only been addressed for early ERP components. Late ERP
components, however, are generally thought to represent superimposed
activities of several anatomically distinct brain areas.  Thus, the question
of which mechanism underlies the genesis of late ERP components cannot be
easily answered based on scalp recordings. In contrast, two well-investigated
late ERP components recorded invasively from within the human medial temporal
lobe (MTL) in epilepsy patients, the so-called MTL-P300 and the anterior
MTL-N400 (AMTL-N400), are based on single source activity. Hence, we
investigated whether the MTL-P300 and the AMTL-N400 are based on an
event-related activity increase, a phase reset of ongoing oscillatory activity
or both. ERPs were recorded from the hippocampus and rhinal cortex in subjects
performing a visual oddball paradigm and a visual word recognition paradigm.
With wavelet techniques, stimulus-related phase-locking and power changes were
analyzed in a frequency range covering 2 to 48 Hz. We found that the MTL-P300
is accompanied by both phase reset and power increase and that both effects
overlap partly in time. In contrast, the AMTL-N400 is initially associated
with phase locking without power increase and only later during the course of
the AMTL-N400 we observed an additional power increase. In conclusion, both
aspects, event-related activation of neural assemblies and phase resetting of
ongoing activity seem to be involved in the generation of late ERP components
as recorded in cognitive tasks. Therefore, separate analysis of event-related
power and phase-locking changes might reveal specific insights into the
mechanisms underlying different cognitive functions.},

to occasional nonwords interspersed among a series of words. A proportion of
the words were repetitions of previously presented items. Words were repeated
after 0 or 6 intervening items in Experiment 1 and after 6 or 19 items in
Experiment 2.  Event-related potentials to repeated words were characterised
by a sustained, widespread positive-going shift with an onset of approximately
300 ms. This effect did not vary significantly as a function of lag in either
experiment.  When words were repeated immediately, this repetition-evoked
positive shift was preceded by a transient negative deflection (onset ca. 200
ms) which was absent in event-related potentials to words repeated at longer
lags. These results suggest that the modulation of event-related potentials by
word repetition is influenced by at least two processes. One of these
processes acts relatively early during the processing of a repeated word, but
subsides rapidly as inter-item lag between first and second presentations
increases. The second process occurs later in time, but is considerably more
robust over variations in inter-item lag.},

	Annote = {Electromagnetic indices of 'fast' (above 12 Hz) oscillating brain
activity are much more likely to be considerably attenuated by time-averaging
across multiple trials than 'slow' (below 12 Hz) oscillating brain activity.
To the extent that both types of oscillations represent the activity of
temporally and topographically separable neural populations, time averaging
can cause a loss of brain activity information that is important both
conceptually and for multimodal integration with hemodynamic techniques. To
address this issue for recognition memory, simultaneous electroencephalography
(EEG) and whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings of explicit word
recognition from 11 healthy subjects were analyzed in two different ways.
First, the time course of neural oscillations ranging from theta (4.5 Hz) to
gamma (42 Hz) frequencies were identified using single-trial continuous
wavelet transforms. Second, traditional analyses of amplitude variations of
time-averaged EEG and MEG signals, event-related potentials (ERPs), and fields
(ERFs) were performed and submitted to distributed source analyses. To
identify data patterns that covaried with the difference between correctly
recognized studied (old) words and correctly rejected nonstudied (new) words,
a multivariate statistical tool, partial least squares (PLS), was applied to
both types of analyses. The results show that ERPs and ERFs are mainly
displaying those neural indices of recognition memory that oscillate in the
theta (4.5-7.5 Hz), alpha (8-11.5), and to some extent in the beta1 (12-19.5
Hz) frequency range. The sources of the ERPs/ERFs were in good agreement with
the topography of theta/alpha/beta 1 oscillations in being confined to the
anterior temporal lobe at 400 ms and being distributed across temporal,
parietal, and occipital areas between 500 and 700 ms.  Gamma oscillations
covaried either positively or negatively with theta/alpha/beta1 oscillations.
A positive covariance, for instance, was detected over left anterior temporal
sensors as early as 200-350 ms and is compatible with studies in rodents
showing that gamma and theta oscillations emerge together out of the
interaction of the hippocampus and the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices.
Fast beta oscillations (20-29.5 Hz), on the other hand, did not strongly
covary with slow oscillations and were likely to arise from neural populations
not adequately represented in ERPs/ERFs. In summary, by providing a more
comprehensive description of electromagnetic signals, time-frequency data are
of potential benefit for integrating electrophysiological and hemodynamic
indices of brain activity and also for integrating human and animal
electrophysiology.},

primacy items tended to be recalled first on List 1 while recency items were
recalled first on List 5. An interpretation of the primacy reduction based
solely on changes in retrieval strategy was ruled out in Exp I-IV. Instead,
the data of all the studies were consistent with the hypothesis that the
reduction in primacy was due to the buildup of interlist proactive
interference. Modifications in retrieval strategy, while not producing any
significant changes in primacy, were found to have a direct influence over
changes in the recency effect; specifically, deviations from a strategy of
initiating recall with last-presented items produced decrements in recency.

that list items that are reported too soon (ahead of their correct serial

words affects performance even under indirect instructions, suggesting that
meaning is retrieved on such tests. The purpose of the present experiments was
to resolve this apparent inconsistency. In Experiment 1, the effects of levels
of processing and meaning set size were evaluated under direct and indirect

size, and instructional effects were evaluated using meaning cues. The
findings indicated that levels effects were determined more by test

	Annote = {Theta-phase precession in hippocampal place cells is one of the
best-studied experimental models of temporal coding in the brain. Theta-phase
precession is a change in spike timing in which the place cell fires at
progressively earlier phases of the extracellular theta rhythm as the animal
crosses the spatially restricted firing field of the neuron. Within individual
theta cycles, this phase advance results in a compressed replication of the
firing sequence of consecutively activated place cells along the animal's
trajectory, at a timescale short enough to enable spike-time-dependent
plasticity between neurons in different parts of the sequence. The neuronal
circuitry required for phase precession has not yet been established.  The
fact that phase precession can be seen in hippocampal output stuctures such as
the prefrontal cortex suggests either that efferent structures inherit the
precession from the hippocampus or that it is generated locally in those
structures. Here we show that phase precession is expressed independently of
the hippocampus in spatially modulated grid cells in layer II of medial
entorhinal cortex, one synapse upstream of the hippocampus. Phase precession
is apparent in nearly all principal cells in layer II but only sparsely in
layer III. The precession in layer II is not blocked by inactivation of the
hippocampus, suggesting that the phase advance is generated in the grid cell
network. The results point to possible mechanisms for grid formation and raise
the possibility that hippocampal phase precession is inherited from entorhinal
cortex.},

                                  sleep (SWS) has proven necessary for

                                  stage. Such observations, together with
                                  recent models of a hippocampal-neocortical

                                  levels facilitate consolidation. We tested
                                  this hypothesis in human subjects by
                                  blocking cholinergic neurotransmission
                                  during wakefulness, starting 30 min after

                                  Compared to placebo, combined muscarinic and
                                  nicotinic receptor blockade significantly

                                  simultaneously impaired acquisition of
                                  similar material. Consolidation of
                                  procedural memories, which are not dependent
                                  on hippocampal functioning, was unaffected.

                                  Our findings support the notion that ACh

that cells in both regions respond to novel stimuli with an increase in firing
(excitation). However, already on the second presentation of a stimulus,
neurons in these regions show very different firing patterns. In the
parahippocampal region there is dramatic decrease in the number of cells
responding to the stimuli, whereas in the hippocampus there is recruitment of
a large subset of neurons showing inhibitory (decrease from baseline firing)
responses. These results suggest that inhibition is a mechanism used by cells
in the human hippocampus to support sparse coding in mnemonic processing. The
findings also provide further evidence for the division of labor in the
medial-temporal lobe with respect to declarative memory processes.},

that patient YR, who suffered a selective bilateral lesion to the hippocampus
in 1986, showed relatively preserved verbal and visual item recognition memory
in the face of clearly impaired verbal and visual recall. In this study, we
found that YR's Yes/No as well as forced-choice recognition of both intra-item
associations and associations between items of the same kind was as well
preserved as her item recognition memory. In contrast, YR was clearly
impaired, and more so than she was on the above kinds of recognition, at
recognition of associations between different kinds of information. Thus, her
recognition memory for associations between objects and their locations, words
and their temporal positions, abstract visual items or words and their
temporal order, animal pictures and names of professions, faces and voices,
faces and spoken names, words and definitions, and pictures and sounds, was
clearly impaired. Several of the different information associative recognition
tests at which YR was impaired could be compared with related item or
inter-item association recognition tests of similar difficulty that she
performed relatively normally around the same time. It is suggested that YR's
familiarity memory for items, intra-item associations, and associations
between items of the same kind was mediated by her intact medial temporal lobe
cortices and was preserved, whereas her hippocampally mediated
recall/recollection of these kinds of information was impaired. It is also
suggested that the components of associations between different kinds of
information are represented in distinct neocortical regions and that initially
they only converge for memory processing within the hippocampus. No
familiarity memory may exist in normal subjects for such associations, and, if
so, YR's often chance recognition occurred because of her severe
recall/recollection deficit. Conflicting data and views are discussed, and the
way in which recall as well as item and associative recognition need to be
systematically explored in patients with apparently selective hippocampal
lesions, in order to resolve existing conflicts, is outlined.},

                                      store information about the

                                      fields, starting with the first exposure
                                      to a cue-altered environment, whereas

selective, and such cells have been called place cells. Similar spatial
correlates have also been described for neurons in the medial entorhinal and
perirhinal cortices. All three regions receive sensory associational input
from postrhinal cortex, which, in turn, is heavily interconnected with
visuospatial neocortical regions. The spatial selectivity of postrhinal cells,
however, has never been examined. Here, we report the activity of neurons in
postrhinal cortex of freely moving rats performing a spatial task on a
four-arm radial maze. Data are also reported for visual association cortex
neurons.The four-arm radial maze was defined by multisensory cues on the
surfaces of the maze arms (proximal) and complex visual cues at the surround
(distal). On each recording day, rats were run in three conditions: baseline,
double cue rotation (proximal +90 degrees; distal -90 degrees ), and baseline.
In this task, hippocampal place field activity is robust and can be controlled
by proximal or distal cues. The majority of postrhinal neurons (64%) exhibited
positional correlates during performance on the task; however, characteristics
of these postrhinal cells were substantially different from those previously
described for hippocampal place cells. Most postrhinal cells with firing
fields exhibited split or multiple subfields (93%). Unlike hippocampal place
fields, the large majority of postrhinal firing fields (84%) adopted new
spatial correlates when experimental cues were rotated, but did so neither
predictably nor concordantly.This is the first report of positional firing
correlates in the postrhinal cortex. The data are consistent with the idea
that postrhinal cortex participates in visuospatial functions by monitoring
changes in environmental stimuli rather than encoding stable spatial cues.
Thus, postrhinal neurons appear to participate in higher-level perceptual
functions rather than mnemonic functions. We propose that the response
properties of postrhinal neurons represent an early step in a spatial pathway
that culminates in the specific and stable place fields of the hippocampus.},

damage causes more severe disruption of episodic memories if those memories
were encoded in the recent rather than the more distant past. This decrease in
sensitivity to damage over time might reflect the formation of multiple traces

links in entorhinal and association cortices. Physiological evidence also
supports a two-stage model of the encoding process in which the initial
encoding occurs during active waking and deeper consolidation occurs via the
formation of additional memory traces during quiet waking or slow-wave sleep.
In this article I will describe the changes in cholinergic tone within the
hippocampus in different stages of the sleep-wake cycle and will propose that
these changes modulate different stages of memory formation. In particular, I
will suggest that the high levels of acetylcholine that are present during
active waking might set the appropriate dynamics for encoding new information
in the hippocampus, by partially suppressing excitatory feedback connections
and so facilitating encoding without interference from previously stored
information. By contrast, the lower levels of acetylcholine that are present
during quiet waking and slow-wave sleep might release this suppression and
thereby allow a stronger spread of activity within the hippocampus itself and
from the hippocampus to the entorhinal cortex, thus facilitating the process
of consolidation of separate memory traces.},

Computational modeling suggests that when acetylcholine levels are high, this
sets appropriate dynamics for the storage of stimuli during performance of
delayed matching tasks. In particular, acetylcholine activates a
calcium-sensitive nonspecific cation current which provides an intrinsic
cellular mechanism which could maintain neuronal activity across a delay
period. Simulations demonstrate how this phenomena could underlie entorhinal
cortex delay activity as described in previous unit recordings. Acetylcholine
also induces theta rhythm oscillations which may be appropriate for timing of
afferent input to be encoded in hippocampus and for extraction of individual
stored sequences from multiple stored sequences.  Lower levels of
acetylcholine may allow sharp wave dynamics which can reactivate associations
encoded in hippocampus and drive the formation of additional traces in

stimulus delivered in the presence of the muscarinic receptor agonist

second excitatory stimulus, and these cells can be repeatedly toggled between
on and off states by consecutive excitatory stimuli. However, the ionic
mechanisms that underlie the production of on and off states in layer III LEC
neurons are unknown but seem to involve activity-dependent conductances, since
they can be initiated by trains of action potentials evoked by either
depolarizing current pulses applied to the cell or by repetitive spiking
induced by activation of excitatory synaptic inputs. In this study, we
obtained intracellular recordings from rat layer III LEC neurons in vitro, and
a series of pharmacological and ionic substitution experiments were performed
to identify mechanisms involved in the induction and termination of persistent
spiking. Our data indicate that initiation of the on state depends on
spike-evoked calcium influx and subsequent activation of calcium-activated
nonselective cationic current. Moreover, we show that termination of
persistent firing in response to an excitatory stimulus can be blocked by
tetraethylammonium or iberiotoxin, suggesting that the activation of
calcium-activated potassium current mediated by large conductance
calcium-activated K(+) (i.e., BK) channels is required to induce the off

intracellular recording with sharp microelectrode in in vitro rat brain

data indicates that in the presence of muscarinic receptor activation,
persistent activity following an excitatory input may be induced and that a
subsequent excitatory input can terminate this activity and cause the neuron
to return to a silent state.  Moreover, application of inhibitory
hyperpolarizing stimuli is neither able to decrease the frequency of the
persistent activity nor terminate it. The persistent activity can also be
initiated and terminated by synchronized synaptic stimuli of layer II/III of

the rhinal sulcus completely and most the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex.
After the injections, the monkeys fixated the cue stimulus normally, relearned
the preoperatively learned set (set-A) and learned a new set (set-B) of paired
associates. Then single units were recorded from the same area as that for the
prelesion control. We found that (i) in spite of the lesion, the sampled
neurons responded strongly and selectively to both the set-A and set-B
patterns, and that (ii) the paired associates elicited significantly
correlated responses in the control neurons but not in the cells tested after
the lesion either for set-A or set-B stimuli. We conclude that the ability of
inferotemporal neurons to represent association between picture pairs was lost
after disruption of backward neural signals from the limbic cortex to the
inferotemporal neurons, while the ability of the neurons to respond to a
particular visual stimulus was left intact.},

	Annote = {In 1998, Sherman and Guillery proposed that there are two types of
inputs to cortical neurons; drivers and modulators.  These two forms of input
are required to explain how, for example, sensory driven responses are
controlled and modified by attention and other internally generated gating
signals. One might imagine that driver signals are carried by fast ionotropic
receptors, whereas modulators correspond to slower metabotropic receptors.
Instead, we have proposed a novel mechanism by which both driver and modulator
inputs could be carried by transmission through the same types of ionotropic
receptors. In this scheme, the distinction between driver and modulator inputs
is functional and changeable rather than anatomical and fixed.  Driver inputs
are carried by excitation and inhibition acting in a push-pull manner.  This
means that increases in excitation are accompanied by decreases in inhibition
and vice versa. Modulators correspond to excitation and inhibition that covary
so that they increase or decrease together.  Theoretical and experimental work
has shown that such an arrangement modulates the gain of a neuron, rather than
driving it to respond. Constructing drivers and modulators in this manner
allows individual excitatory synaptic inputs to play either role, and indeed
to switch between roles, depending on how they are linked with inhibition.},

results establish that hippocampal pyramidal cells are 'complex spike cells,'

The results also establish that the monkey hippocampal EEG shows 'sharp wave'
events consisting of a high-frequency 'ripple' oscillation ( approximately 110
Hz) together with a large slow-wave EEG deflection lasting several hundred
milliseconds. The evidence suggests that monkey sharp waves are probably
generated mainly in the CA1 region and that sharp waves are associated with an
inactive/drowsy-or-sleeping behavioral state, which is also associated with
increased hippocampal pyramidal cell activity and increased hippocampal EEG
amplitude. The results of this initial study of ensembles of primate
hippocampal neurons are consistent with previous studies in rodents and
consistent with the hypothesis that theories and models of hippocampal memory

the fine adjustment of this feedback loop might emerge in a self-organizing

a learning signal. This self-organizing process is based on the present
observation that the variance of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and the
variance of the neural firing rate and of activity-dependent conductances
reach a maximum as the biophysical parameters of a cell approach a

connections has not been presented. Here, we have summarized the cortical,
subcortical, and hippocampal connections of the lateral entorhinal area (LEA)
and the medial entorhinal area (MEA) in the rat. We found that the targets and
relative strengths of the entorhinal connections are strikingly different for
the LEA and MEA. For example, the LEA receives considerably heavier input from
the piriform and insular cortices, whereas the MEA is more heavily targeted by
the visual, posterior parietal, and retrosplenial cortices. Regarding
subcortical connections, the LEA receives heavy input from the amygdala and
olfactory structures, whereas the MEA is targeted by the dorsal thalamus,
primarily the midline nuclei and also the dorsolateral and dorsoanterior
thalamic nuclei. Differences in the LEA and MEA connections with hippocampal
and parahippocampal structures are also described. In addition, because the EC
is characterized by bands of intrinsic connectivity that span the LEA and MEA
and project to different septotemporal levels of the dentate gyrus, special
attention was paid to the efferents and afferents of those bands. Finally, we
summarized the connections of the dorsocaudal MEA, the region in which the

diversity within the EC. It is hoped that these findings will inform future

perirhinal, postrhinal, and entorhinal cortices, the presubiculum, and the

been a focus in memory research because they supply highly processed,
polymodal sensory information to the hippocampus, both directly and via the
entorhinal cortex. Available evidence indicates that these cortices receive
different complements of cortical information, which are then forwarded to the
hippocampus via parallel pathways.Here we have summarized the cortical,
subcortical, and hippocampal connections of the perirhinal and postrhinal
cortices in order to provide further insight into the nature of the
information that is processed by these regions prior to arriving in the
hippocampus. As has been previously described, the cortical afferents of the
rodent postrhinal cortex are dominated by structures known to be involved in
the processing of visual and spatial information, whereas the cortical
afferents of the perirhinal cortex result in remarkable convergence of
polymodal sensory information. The two regions are also differentiated by
their cortical efferents.  The perirhinal cortex projects more strongly to
piriform, frontal, and insular regions, whereas the postrhinal cortex projects
preferentially to visual and visuospatial regions. The subcortical connections
of the two regions provide further evidence that they have different
functions. For example, the perirhinal cortex has strong reciprocal
connections with the amygdala, which suggest involvement in processing
affective stimuli.  Subcortical input to the postrhinal cortex is dominated by
projections from dorsal thalamic structures, particularly the lateral
posterior nucleus. Although the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices are
considered to contribute to the episodic memory system, many questions remain
about their particular roles. A detailed description of the anatomical

              critical role in novelty detection through its ability to act as

              provided evidence for this hypothesis by characterizing
              hippocampal responses to sequence novelty, a type of associative
              novelty where familiar items appear in a new temporal order.
              Here, we ask whether a hippocampal match-mismatch (i.e.,
              comparator) mechanism operates selectively to identify the
              violation of predictions within the temporal domain or instead
              also underlies the processing of associative novelty in other
              domains (e.g., spatial). We used functional magnetic resonance
              imaging and a repetition paradigm in which subjects viewed
              sequences of objects presented in distinct locations on the
              screen and performed an incidental target detection task. The
              left hippocampus exhibited a pattern of activity consistent with
              that of an associative match-mismatch detector, with novelty
              signals generated only in conditions where one contextual
              component was novel and the other repeated. In contrast, right
              hippocampal activation signaled the presence of objects in

              match-mismatch computations constitute a general mechanism

processes including attention, learning and memory. Muscarinic actions have
profound effects on the intrinsic firing pattern of neurons. In principal
neurons of the entorhinal cortex (EC), muscarinic receptors activate an
intrinsic cation current that causes multiple self-sustained spiking activity,
which represents a potential mechanism for transiently sustaining information
about novel items. The amygdala appears to be important for
experience-dependent learning by emotional arousal, and cholinergic muscarinic
influences are essential for the amygdala-mediated modulation of memory. Here
we show that principal neurons from the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA)
can generate intrinsic graded persistent activity that is similar to EC layer
V cells. This firing behavior is linked to muscarinic activation of a
calcium-sensitive non-specific cation current and can be mimicked by
stimulation of cholinergic afferents that originate from the nucleus basalis
of Meynert (n. M). Moreover, we demonstrate that the projections from the n.
M. are essential and sufficient for the control and modulation of graded
firing activity in LA neurons. We found that activation of these cholinergic
afferents (i) is required to maintain and to increase firing rates in a graded
manner, and (ii) is sufficient for the graded increases of stable discharge
rates even without an associated up-regulation of Ca2+. The induction of
persistent activity was blocked by flufenamic acid or 2-APB and remained
intact after Ca2+-store depletion with thapsigargin. The internal ability of

whether judgments of recollection might also be subject to inferential

important to deal correctly with temporal autocorrelation in the noise.  Most
of the approaches in the literature adopt a two-stage approach in which the
autocorrelation structure is estimated using the residuals of an initial model

the model is refit to obtain final activation parameter estimates. An
assumption implicit in this scheme is that the residuals from the initial
model fit represent a realization of the 'true' noise process. In general this
assumption will not be correct as certain components of the noise will be
removed by the model fit. In this paper we examine (i) the form of the bias
induced by the initial model fit, (ii) methods of correcting for the bias, and
(iii) the impact of bias correction on the model parameter estimates. We find
that while bias correction does result in more accurate estimates of the
correlation structure, this does not translate into improved estimates of the
model parameters. In fact estimates of the model parameters and their standard
errors are seen to be so accurate that we conclude that bias correction is
unnecessary.},

analysis.  Whitening serially correlated data is the most efficient approach
to parameter estimation. However, if there is a discrepancy between the

exquisitely sensitive to bias when estimating the standard error of the
ensuing parameter estimates. This bias, although not expressed in terms of the
estimated responses, has profound effects on any statistic used for inference.
The special constraints of fMRI analysis ensure that there will always be a
misspecification of the assumed serial correlations. One resolution of this
problem is to filter the data to minimize bias, while maintaining a reasonable
degree of efficiency. In this paper we present expressions for efficiency (of
parameter estimation) and bias (in estimating standard error) in terms of
assumed and actual correlation structures in the context of the general linear
model. We show that: (i) Whitening strategies can result in profound bias and
are therefore probably precluded in parametric fMRI data analyses. (ii)
Band-pass filtering, and implicitly smoothing, has an important role in
protecting against inferential bias.},

	Abstract = {Persistent firing is believed to be a crucial mechanism for memory function including working memory. Recent in vivo and in vitro findings suggest an involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in persistent firing. Using whole-cell patch-recording techniques in a rat entorhinal cortex (EC) slice preparation, we tested whether EC layer III
neurons display persistent firing due to mGluR activation, independently of cholinergic activation. Stimulation of the angular bundle drove persistent firing in 90% of the cells in the absence of a cholinergic agonist. The persistent firing was typically stable for > 4.5 min at which point persistent firing was terminated by the experimenter. The average frequency of the persistent firing was 2.1 Hz, ranging from 0.4 to 5.5 Hz. This persistent firing was observed even in the presence of atropine (2 microM), suggesting that the persistent firing can occur independent of cholinergic activation. Furthermore, ionotropic glutamate and GABAergic synaptic blockers (2 mM kynurenic acid, 100 microM picrotoxin and 1 microM CGP55845) did not block the persistent firing. On the other hand, blockers of group I mGluRs (100 microM LY367385 and 20 microM MPEP) completely blocked or suppressed the persistent firing. An agonist of group I mGluRs (20 microM DHPG) greatly enhanced the persistent firing induced by current injection. These results indicate that persistent firing can be driven through group I mGluRs in entorhinal layer III neurons, suggesting that glutamatergic synaptic input alone could enable postsynaptic neurons to hold input signals in the form of persistent firing.},

comprehension system relates an incoming word to semantic representations of

occasionally contained a critical word that, although acceptable in the local
sentence context, was semantically anomalous with respect to the wider
discourse (e.g., Jane told the brother that he was exceptionally slow in a
discourse context where he had in fact been very quick). Relative to coherent
control words (e.g., quick), these discourse-dependent semantic anomalies
elicited a large N400 effect that began at about 200 to 250 msec after word
onset. In Experiment 2, the same sentences were presented without their
original story context. Although the words that had previously been anomalous
in discourse still elicited a slightly larger average N400 than the coherent
words, the resulting N400 effect was much reduced, showing that the large
effect observed in stories depended on the wider discourse. In the same
experiment, single sentences that contained a clear local semantic anomaly
elicited a standard sentence-dependent N400 effect (e.g., Kutas \&Hillyard,
1980). The N400 effects elicited in discourse and in single sentences had the
same time course, overall morphology, and scalp distribution. We argue that
these findings are most compatible with models of language processing in which
there is no fundamental distinction between the integration of a word in its

              can, the brain uses context to predict features of likely
              upcoming items. However, although prediction seems important for
              comprehension, it also appears susceptible to age-related
              deterioration and can be associated with processing costs. The
              brain may address this trade-off by employing multiple
              processing strategies, distributed across the two cerebral
              hemispheres. In particular, left hemisphere language processing
              seems to be oriented toward prediction and the use of top-down
              cues, whereas right hemisphere comprehension is more bottom-up,
              biased toward the veridical maintenance of information. Such
              asymmetries may arise, in turn, because language comprehension
              mechanisms are integrated with language production mechanisms
              only in the left hemisphere (the PARLO framework).},

controversial whether lower structures in this hierarchy, such as perirhinal
cortex, support memory functions that are distinct from those of higher
structures, in particular the hippocampus.  Perirhinal cortex has been
proposed to play a specific role in the assessment of familiarity during
recognition, which can be distinguished from the selective contributions of
the hippocampus to the recollection of episodic detail. Some researchers have
argued, however, that the distinction between familiarity and recollection

single-process accounts. Evidence supporting the dual-process view comes from
demonstrations that selective hippocampal damage can produce isolated
recollection impairments. It is unclear, however, whether temporal-lobe
lesions that spare the hippocampus can produce selective familiarity
impairments. Without this demonstration, single-process accounts cannot be
ruled out. We examined recognition memory in NB, an individual who underwent
surgical resection of left anterior temporal-lobe structures for treatment of
intractable epilepsy. Her resection included a large portion of perirhinal
cortex but spared the hippocampus. The results of four experiments based on

dorsolateral prefrontal lesions in working memory, strategy switching, and
temporal ordering. None, however, has examined the role of the rodent mPFC in
recognition memory, wherein, in humans, dorsolateral prefrontal damage results
in a deficit in source monitoring resulting in impaired recollection. In the
present study, we examined recognition memory in rats with bilateral mPFC
lesions (prelimbic/infralimbic regions; ibotenic acid) using a variant of a
non-match-to-sample task with manipulations of response bias that allowed for
a signal detection analysis that distinguishes recollection and familiarity
contributions to recognition memory. Animals with medial prefrontal lesions
had a modest overall deficit in recognition with no general change in their

indicated that rats with mPFC damage had a curvilinear and symmetrical
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, compared with a curvilinear and
asymmetrical ROC curve in control subjects, indicating that mPFC damage
severely reduced recollection-based performance, while sparing familiarity.
The recollection failure was associated with an impaired ability to reject new
items (increased false alarm rate), whereas the identification of old items
(hit rate) was normal. This pattern of findings is similar to that observed in

cortical ablation, even though extinction of emotional conditioning is
retarded by cortical ablation. The model simulates how increasing the duration
of an unconditioned stimulus increases the amplitude of emotional
conditioning, but does not change adaptive timing; and how an increase in the
intensity of a conditioned stimulus 'speeds up the clock', but an increase in
the intensity of an unconditioned stimulus does not. Computer simulations of
the model fit parametric conditioning data, including a Weber law property and
an inverted U property. Both primary and secondary adaptively timed
conditionings are simulated, as are data concerning conditioning using
multiple interstimulus intervals (ISIs), gradually or abruptly changing ISIs,
partial reinforcement and multiple stimuli that lead to time-averaging of
responses. Neurobiologically testable predictions are made to facilitate
further tests of the model.},

a constant scaling factor H = fG. This constant scaling factor between
temporal oscillation frequency and spatial periodicity provides a starting

speed of movement, about the independence of single cell properties from
network theta rhythm oscillations, and about the effect of variations in
initial oscillatory phase on the pattern of grid cell firing fields. These

component until the 2nd component has occurred. When the temporal gap to be

limited-capacity, short-term store is sufficient to allow associations to be

is not thought to affect the long-term storage of associations of any kind, if
they can be formed. Analyses of research data show that by classifying tasks
in terms of the need to use a temporary memory store to retain temporally

depends on 2 distinguishable memory signals. Recollection reflects conscious
recovery of detailed information about the learning episode.  Familiarity
reflects a memory signal that is not accompanied by a vivid conscious
experience but nonetheless enables participants to distinguish recently

recognition memory has gained wide acceptance among cognitive neuroscientists
and some cognitive psychologists. Nonetheless, its difficulty in providing a
quantitatively satisfactory description of performance has precluded a
consensus not only regarding the theoretical structure of recognition memory
but also about how to best measure recognition accuracy. In 2 experiments we
show that neither the standard formulation of dual-process signal detection
(DPSD) theory nor a widely used single-process model called the
unequal-variance signal-detection (UVSD) model provides a satisfactory
explanation of recognition memory across different types of stimuli (words and
		travel scenes). In the variable-recollection dual-process
(VRDP) model, recollection fails for some old probe items, as in standard
formulations of DPSD, but gives rise to a continuous distribution of memory
strengths when it succeeds. The VRDP can approximate both the DPSD and UVSD.
In both experiments it provides a consistently superior fit across materials
to the superset of the DPSD and UVSD. The VRDP offers a simple explanation of
the form of conjoint item-source judgments, something neither the DPSD nor
UVSD accomplishes. The success of the VRDP supports the core assumptions of

			      subdivided into about seven subcycles by high
			      frequency gamma oscillations (20-60 Hz). It has
			      been proposed (Lisman and Idiart 1995) that such

			      seven memories, a capability of human STM. A
			      memory is encoded by a subset of principal
neurons that fire synchronously in a particular gamma subcycle. Firing is
maintained by a membrane process intrinsic to each cell. We now extend this
model by incorporating recurrent connections with modifiable synapses to store
long-term memory (LTM). The repetition provided by STM gradually modifies
synapses in a physiologically realistic way. Because different memories are
active in different gamma subcycles, the formation of autoassociative LTM
requires that synaptic modification depend on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
	channels having a time constant of deactivation that is of the same
	order as the duration of a gamma subcycle (15-50 msec). Many types of
	NMDA channels have longer time constants (150 msec), as for instance
	those found in the hippocampus, but both fast and slow NMDA channels
	are present in cortex. This is the first proposal for the special role
	of these fast NMDA channels. The STM for novel items must depend on
	activity-dependent changes intrinsic to neurons rather than recurrent
	connections, which have not developed the required selectivity.
	Because these intrinsic mechanisms are not error-correcting, STM will
	become slowly corrupted by noise. This limits the accuracy with which
	LTM can become encoded after a single presentation. Accurate encoding
	of items in LTM can be achieved by multiple presentations, provided
	different memory items are presented in a varied interleaved order.

					of a low frequency theta oscillation.
					The NMDA channels are in the synapses

					Because slow NMDA channels have a time
	  constant that spans several gamma cycles, synaptic connections will
	  form between cells that represent different memories. This enables
	  brain structures that have slow NMDA channels to store
	  heteroassociative sequence information in long-term memory. Recall
	  of this stored sequence information can be initiated by presentation
	  of initial elements of the sequence. The remaining sequence is then
	  recalled at a rate of one memory every gamma cycle. A new role for
	  the NMDA channel suggested by our finding is that recall at gamma
	  frequency works well if slow NMDA channels provide the dominant
	  component of the EPSP at the synapse of recurrent collaterals: The
	  slow onset of these channels and their long duration allows the
	  firing of one memory during one gamma cycle to trigger the next
	  memory during the subsequent gamma cycle. An interesting feature of
	  the readout mechanism is that the activation of a given memory is
	  due to cumulative input from multiple previous memories in the
	  stored sequence, not just the previous one. The network thus stores
	  sequence information in a doubly redundant way: Activation of a
	  memory depends on the strength of synaptic inputs from multiple
	  cells of multiple previous memories. The cumulative property of
	  sequence storage has support from the psychophysical literature.
	  Cumulative learning also provides a solution to the disambiguation
	  problem that occurs when different sequences have a region of
	  overlap. In a final set of simulations, we show how coupling an
	  autoassociative network to a heteroassociative network allows the
	  storage of episodic memories (a unique sequence of briefly occurring
			  known items). The autoassociative network (cortex)
	captures the sequence in short-term memory and provides the accurate,

	Annote = {Five conditioned lick-suppression experiments with water-deprived
rats examined the possibility that simultaneous and backward associations are
learned, but are not expressed as anticipatory responses in common indexes of
associative strength. Experiments 1--4 used a sensory preconditioning procedure
in which clicks preceded the onset of a tone. Subsequently, the tone was
paired with footshock in either a forward, simultaneous, or backward
arrangement. In no case did the tone trained in the simultaneous or backward
manner elicit a conditioned response. However, Experiments 1, 2, and 3
determined that the clicks, which predicted the tone, evoked equally strong
conditioned responses regardless of whether the tone was paired with the shock
in a forward, simultaneous, or backward manner. Experiment 4 found that
responding to the clicks was degraded following postconditioning extinction of
the tone, regardless of whether the tone had been paired with the shock in a
forward or simultaneous manner. Experiment 5 determined that if the click and
tone were paired simultaneously, the click failed a test for excitation
following tone-shock simultaneous pairings but passed a test for excitation
following tone-shock forward pairings. Collectively, these findings suggest
that predictive information (i.e., a forward relationship between stimuli) is
not necessary for the acquisition of an association, but may promote the
expression of the association in an anticipatory response system. Moreover,
	   these results suggest that associations are not simple linkages,
	   but contain information regarding the temporal relationship of the
	   associates.},

			      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
			      is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder of
			      childhood. There is considerable evidence that
			      brain dopamine is involved in ADHD, but it is
			      unclear whether dopamine activity is enhanced or
			      depressed. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypotheses
			      that striatal dopamine activity is depressed in
			      ADHD and that this contributes to symptoms of
inattention. DESIGN: Clinical (ADHD adult) and comparison (healthy control)
	subjects were scanned with positron emission tomography and raclopride
	labeled with carbon 11 (D2/D3 receptor radioligand sensitive to
			competition with endogenous dopamine) after placebo
	and after intravenous methylphenidate hydrochloride (stimulant that
			increases extracellular dopamine by blocking dopamine
			transporters). The difference in [11C]raclopride's
	specific binding between placebo and methylphenidate was used as
	marker of dopamine release. Symptoms were quantified using the Conners
	Adult ADHD Rating Scales. SETTING: Outpatient setting. PARTICIPANTS:
	Nineteen adults with ADHD who had never received medication and 24
	healthy controls. RESULTS: With the placebo, D2/D3 receptor
	availability in left caudate was lower (P < .05) in subjects with ADHD
	than in controls. Methylphenidate induced smaller decrements in
	[11C]raclopride binding in left and right caudate (blunted DA
			increases) (P < .05) and higher scores on self-reports
	of 'drug liking' in ADHD than in control subjects. The blunted
	response to methylphenidate in caudate was associated with symptoms of
	inattention (P < .05) and with higher self-reports of drug liking (P <
			.01). Exploratory analysis using statistical
	parametric mapping revealed that methylphenidate also decreased
	[11C]raclopride binding in hippocampus and amygdala and that these
	decrements were smaller in subjects with ADHD (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS:
	This study reveals depressed dopamine activity in caudate and
	preliminary evidence in limbic regions in adults with ADHD that was
	associated with inattention and with enhanced reinforcing responses to
	intravenous methylphenidate. This suggests that dopamine dysfunction
	is involved with symptoms of inattention but may also contribute to
	substance abuse comorbidity in ADHD.},

processing, is particularly vulnerable to aging. Significant losses over a

age-related dopaminergic decline. In animals, a substantial body of data
indicates that dopamine activity in the midbrain is tightly associated with
reward processing. In humans, although indirect evidence from pharmacological
and clinical studies also supports such an association, there has been no
direct demonstration of a link between midbrain dopamine and reward-related
neural response. Moreover, there are no in vivo data for alterations in this

positron emission tomography (PET) and event-related 3T functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) in the same subjects, we directly demonstrate a link
between midbrain dopamine synthesis and reward-related prefrontal activity in
humans, show that healthy aging induces functional alterations in the reward
system, and identify an age-related change in the direction of the
relationship (from a positive to a negative correlation) between midbrain
dopamine synthesis and prefrontal activity. These results indicate an
age-dependent dopaminergic tuning mechanism for cortical reward processing and
provide system-level information about alteration of a key neural circuit in
healthy aging. Taken together, our findings provide an important
characterization of the interactions between midbrain dopamine function and
the reward system in healthy young humans and older subjects, and identify the
changes in this regulatory circuit that accompany aging.},

investigated how striatal FMT signal related to a cognitive measure of frontal
lobe function. Older adults showed significantly greater striatal FMT signal
than younger adults. Within the older group, FMT signal in dorsal caudate
(DCA) and dorsal putamen was greater with age, suggesting compensation for
deficits elsewhere in the dopamine system. In younger adults, FMT signal in
DCA was lower with age, likely related to ongoing developmental processes.
Younger adults who performed worse on tests of frontal lobe function showed
greater FMT signal in right DCA, independent of age effects. Our data suggest
that higher striatal FMT signal represents nonoptimal dopamine processing.
They further support a relationship between striatal dopamine processing and

allows the believed state of the world to distribute across sets of equivalent
states. Distributed exponential discounting factors produce hyperbolic
discounting in the behavior of the agent itself. We examine these issues in the
context of a TD RL model in which state-belief is distributed over a set of
exponentially-discounting 'micro-Agents', each of which has a separate
discounting factor (gamma). Each microAgent maintains an independent hypothesis
about the state of the world, and a separate value-estimate of taking actions
within that hypothesized state. The overall agent thus instantiates a flexible
representation of an evolving world-state. As with other TD models, the
value-error (delta) signal within the model matches dopamine signals recorded
from animals in standard conditioning reward-paradigms. The distributed
representation of belief provides an explanation for the decrease in dopamine
at the conditioned stimulus seen in overtrained animals, for the differences
between trace and delay conditioning, and for transient bursts of dopamine seen
at movement initiation. Because each microAgent also includes its own

dopamine neurons label environmental stimuli with appetitive value, predict
and detect rewards and signal alerting and motivating events. By failing to
discriminate between different rewards, dopamine neurons appear to emit an
alerting message about the surprising presence or absence of rewards. All
responses to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli depend on event
predictability. Dopamine neurons are activated by rewarding events that are
better than predicted, remain uninfluenced by events that are as good as
predicted, and are depressed by events that are worse than predicted. By
signaling rewards according to a prediction error, dopamine responses have the
formal characteristics of a teaching signal postulated by reinforcement
learning theories. Dopamine responses transfer during learning from primary
rewards to reward-predicting stimuli. This may contribute to neuronal
mechanisms underlying the retrograde action of rewards, one of the main
puzzles in reinforcement learning. The impulse response releases a short pulse
of dopamine onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather global
reinforcement signal to postsynaptic neurons. This signal may improve approach
behavior by providing advance reward information before the behavior occurs,
	 and may contribute to learning by modifying synaptic transmission.
	 The dopamine reward signal is supplemented by activity in neurons in
	 striatum, frontal cortex, and amygdala, which process specific reward
	 information but do not emit a global reward prediction error signal.
	 A cooperation between the different reward signals may assure the use
	 of specific rewards for selectively reinforcing behaviors. Among the
	 other projection systems, noradrenaline neurons predominantly serve
	 attentional mechanisms and nucleus basalis neurons code rewards
	 heterogeneously. Cerebellar climbing fibers signal errors in motor
	 performance or errors in the prediction of aversive events to
	 cerebellar Purkinje cells. Most deficits following dopamine-depleting

(ADHD) is a prevalent and debilitating disorder diagnosed on the basis of
persistent and developmentally-inappropriate levels of overactivity,

incompletely understood. There is evidence of a genetic basis for ADHD but it
is likely to involve many genes of small individual effect. Differences in the
dimensions of the frontal lobes, caudate nucleus, and cerebellar vermis have
been demonstrated.  Neuropsychological testing has revealed a number of well
documented differences between children with and without ADHD. These occur in
two main domains: executive function and motivation although neither of these
is specific to ADHD. In view of the recent advances in the neurobiology of
reinforcement, we concentrate in this review on altered reinforcement
mechanisms. Among the motivational differences, many pieces of evidence
indicate that an altered response to reinforcement may play a central role in
the symptoms of ADHD. In particular, sensitivity to delay of reinforcement
appears to be a reliable finding. We review neurobiological mechanisms of
reinforcement and discuss how these may be altered in ADHD, with particular
focus on the neurotransmitter dopamine and its actions at the cellular and
systems level. We describe how dopamine cell firing activity is normally
associated with reinforcing events, and transfers to earlier time-points in
the behavioural sequence as reinforcement becomes more predictable. We discuss
how a failure of this transfer may give rise to many symptoms of ADHD, and
propose that methylphenidate might act to compensate for the proposed dopamine
transfer deficit.},

					responses reflect different levels of
					a single strength-of-evidence
					dimension. Thus, across conditions in

	  In those studies, non-memory-related differences between conditions

					    Presentation (RSVP) paradigm, and
					    found that temporal accuracy is

	      the Attentional Blink (AB) phenomenon. In this article, we use
	      electroencephalography (EEG) to directly investigate the
	      temporal dynamics of conscious perception. Specifically,
	      employing a combination of experimental analysis and neural
	      network modelling, we test the hypothesis that the availability
	      of attention reduces temporal jitter in the latency between a
	      target's visual onset and its consolidation into working memory.
	      We perform time-frequency analysis on data from an AB study to
	      compare the EEG trials underlying the P3 ERPs (Event-related
			      Potential) evoked by targets seen outside vs.
	      inside the AB time window. We find visual differences in

	      variance of the P3 phase distributions. These results argue for
	      increased variation in the latency of conscious perception
	      during the AB. This experimental analysis is complemented by a
	      theoretical exploration of temporal attention and target
	      processing. Using activation traces from the Neural-ST(2) model,
	      we generate virtual ERPs and virtual ERPimages. These are
	      compared to their human counterparts to propose an explanation

	      the temporal variability of selective attention. The AB provides
	      us with a suitable phenomenon with which to investigate the
	      interplay between attention and perception. The combination of

		dentate gyrus produces sparse representations by competitive
		learning and via the mossy fiber pathway forces new
		representations on the CA3 during learning (encoding), it has
		been shown behaviorally that the dentate gyrus supports
		spatial pattern separation during learning. Based on the
		computational proposal that CA3-CA3 autoassociative networks
		are important for episodic memory, it has been shown
		behaviorally that the CA3 supports spatial rapid one-trial
		learning, learning of arbitrary associations where space is a
		component, pattern completion, spatial short-term memory, and
		sequence learning by associations formed between successive
		items. The concept that the CA1 recodes information from CA3
		and sets up associatively learned backprojections to neocortex
		to allow subsequent retrieval of information to neocortex, is
		consistent with findings on consolidation. Behaviorally, the
		CA1 is implicated in processing temporal information as shown
		by investigations requiring temporal order pattern separation
		and associations across time; computationally this could
		involve temporal decay memory, and temporal sequence memory
		which might also require CA3. The perforant path input to DG
		is implicated in learning, to CA3 in retrieval from CA3, and

We found a much slower form of integration that leads to action potential initiation in the distal axon, well beyond the initial segment. In a subset of rodent hippocampal and neocortical interneurons,  hundreds of spikes, evoked over minutes, resulted in persistent firing that lasted for a similar duration. Although axonal action potential firing was required to trigger persistent firing, somatic depolarization was not. In paired recordings, persistent firing was not restricted to the stimulated neuron; it could also be produced in the unstimulated cell. Thus, these interneurons can slowly integrate spiking, share the output across a coupled network of axons and respond with persistent firing even in the absence of input to the soma or dendrites.},

				       Hupbach, Gomez, and Nadel (Memory, 17,
					       502-510, 2009) suggests that
				       episodic memory for a previously
				       studied list can be updated to include
				       new items, if participants are reminded
				       of the earlier list just prior to
				       learning a new list. The key finding
				       from the Hupbach studies was an
				       asymmetric pattern of intrusions,
				       whereby participants intruded numerous
				       items from the second list when trying
				       to recall the first list, but not
				       viceversa. Hupbach et al. (2007; 2009)
				       explained this pattern in terms of a
				       cellular reconsolidation process,
				       whereby first-list memory is rendered
				       labile by the reminder and the labile
				       memory is then updated to include items
				       from the second list. Here, we show
				       that the temporal context model of
				       memory, which lacks a cellular
				       reconsolidation process, can account
				       for the asymmetric intrusion effect,
				       using well-established principles of

This coupling has led to a common assumption in cognitive neuroscience that stimulus-evoked activity in these regions only reflects information about the current stimulus. Here we challenge this assumption for how scenes are represented in a scene- selective region of parahippocampal cortex. This region treated two identical scenes as more similar when they were preceded in time by the same stimuli compared to when they were preceded by different stimuli. These findings suggest that parahippocampal cortex embeds scenes in their temporal context to determine what they represent. By integrating the past and present, such representations may support the encoding and navigation of complex environments.},

	Hippocampal place cells can show similar firing patterns across

	and the role of experience and learning in generating it are not
	understood.  We therefore examined rat hippocampal place cell activity
	in the context of spatial tasks with multiple similar spatial
	trajectories.  We found that, in environments with repeating elements,
	about half of the recorded place cells showed path-equivalent firing,
	where individual neurons are active in multiple similar locations.  In
	contrast, place cells from animals performing a similar task in an
	environment with fewer similar elements were less likely to fire in a
path- equivalent manner.  Moreover, in the environment with multiple repeating
elements, path equivalence developed with experience in the task, and
increased path equivalence was associated with increased moment-by-moment
correlations between pairs of path-equivalent neurons.  As a result,
	     correlated firing among path-equivalent neurons increased with
	     experience.  These findings suggest that coordi- nated
	     hippocampal ensembles can encode generalizations across

	enclosure, the walls of the small box were quickly removed, leaving
	the rat free to continue foraging in the whole area enclosed by the
	larger box. The rate-responses of most recorded cells (70 out of 93
			cells, including 15 of 16 putative interneurons) were
	considered spatially modulated based on information-theoretic
	analysis. A number of cells that resembled classic hippocampal place
	cells in the small box were revealed to be grid cells in the larger
	box. In contrast, other cells that fired along the boundaries or
	corners of the small box did not show grid-cell firing in the large
	box, but instead fired along the corresponding locations of the large
	box. Remapping of the spatial response in the area corresponding to
	the small box after the removal of its walls was prominent in most
	spatially modulated cells. These results show that manipulation of
	local boundaries can exert a powerful influence on the spatial firing
	patterns of MEC cells even when the manipulations leave global cues
	unchanged and allow uninterrupted, self-motion-based localization.
	Further, they suggest the presence of landmark-related information in
	MEC, which might prevent cumulative drift of the spatial

quantitative measure of the ensemble activity alignment and was used to

temporal gaps in our experience. In our current functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) study, we systematically controlled the extent to which a
target and an event detail have to be integrated across spatiotemporal
discontiguities during associative memory formation. Although the encoding
task, the type of association, and subsequent memory performance were held

	Annote = {ABSTRACT: The perirhinal and lateral entorhinal cortices send promi-
nent projections to the portion of the hippocampal CA1 subfield closest to the
subiculum, but relatively little is known regarding the contribu- tions of
these cortical areas to hippocampal activity patterns. The anatomical
connections of the lateral entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, as well as
lesion data, suggest that these brain regions may contribute to the perception
of complex stimuli such as objects. The current experiments investigated the
degree to which three-dimensional objects affect place field size and activity
within the distal region (closest to the subiculum) of CA1. The activity of
CA1 pyramidal cells was monitored as rats traversed a circular track that
contained no objects in some con- ditions and three-dimensional objects in
other conditions. In the area of CA1 that receives direct lateral entorhinal
input, three factors differenti- ated the objects-on-track conditions from the
no-object conditions: more pyramidal cells expressed place fields when objects
were present, adding or removing objects from the environment led to partial
remap- ping in CA1, and the size of place fields decreased when objects were
present. In addition, a proportion of place fields remapped under condi- tions
in which the object locations were shuffled, which suggests that at least some
of the CA1 neurons' firing patterns were sensitive to a partic- ular object in
a particular location. Together, these data suggest that the activity
characteristics of neurons in the areas of CA1 receiving direct input from the
perirhinal and lateral entorhinal cortices are modulated by non-spatial
sensory input such as three-dimensional objects.},

	Annote = { ABSTRACT: Computational models suggest that the hippocampus plays
an important role in the retrieval of sequences. However, empiri- cal evidence
supporting hippocampal involvement during sequence re- trieval is lacking. The
current study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the
role of the human hippocampus during the learning and retrieval of sequences.
Participants were asked to learn four sequences comprised of six faces each.
An overlapping condition, where sequences shared common elements, was
comprised of two sequences in which two identical faces were shown as the
middle images of both sequences. A nonoverlapping condition contained two
sequences that did not share any faces between them. A third random condition
contained two sets of six faces that were always presented in a random order.
The fMRI data were split into a learning phase and an experienced phase based
upon each individual's behavioral perform- ance. Patterns of hippocampal
activity during presentation, delay, and choice periods were assessed both
during learning (learning phase) and after subjects learned the sequences to
criteria (experienced phase). The results revealed hippocampal activation
during sequence learning, con- sistent with previous findings in rats and
humans. Critically, the current results revealed hippocampal activation during
the retrieval of learned sequences. No difference in hippocampal activation
was seen between the overlapping and nonoverlapping sequences during either
sequence learning or retrieval of sequences. The results extend our current
knowl- edge by providing evidence that the hippocampus is active during the
retrieval of learned sequences, consistent with current computational models
of sequence learning and retrieval. },

	Abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of episodic memory requires linking behavioral data and lesion effects to data on the dynamics of cellular membrane potentials and population interactions within brain regions. Linking behavior to specific membrane channels and neurochemicals has implications for therapeutic applications. Lesions of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and subcortical nuclei impair episodic memory function in humans and animals,  and unit recording data from these regions in behaving animals indicate episodic memory processes. Intracellular recording in these regions demonstrates specific cel- lular properties including resonance, membrane potential oscillations and bistable persistent spiking that could underlie the encoding and retrieval of episodic trajectories. A model presented here shows how intrinsic dynamical properties of neurons could mediate the encoding of episodic memories as complex spatiotemporal trajectories. The dynamics of neurons allow encoding and retrieval of unique episodic trajectories in multiple continuous dimensions including temporal intervals, personal location, the spatial coordinates and sensory features of perceived objects and generated actions, and associations between these elements. The model also addresses how cellular dynamics could underlie unit firing data suggesting mechanisms for coding continuous dimensions of space, time, sensation and action.},

trajectory of directions in this 'concept space.' We find that memory of the

				      timing tasks (including fixed-interval
					      and temporal differentiation
					      schedules, stimulus timing,
					      aversive conditioning, and
					      Pavlovian methods) with respect
				      to conformity to the two scalar
				      properties of timing behaviour: mean
				      accuracy and scalar (Weberian) variance.
				      Systematic deviations were found in data
				      from temporal differentiation schedules,
				      timing of very short (<100 ms) or very
	long (>100 s) durations, effects of 'task difficulty', and some
	special cases where circadian and interval timing seemed to interact,
	or where some specific durations seemed to be timed more precisely
	than others. Theoretical reconciliation of some of these deviations
	with underlying scalar timing can be achieved, but a number of
	problematical cases remain unexplained.},
